Squalene (1), polyprenol (2), triglycerides (3), and -sitosterol (4), isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum, were evaluated for their anti-proliferative activities against three human cancer cell lines, breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and a normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast neonatal (HDFn) using the in vitro PrestoBlue cell viability assay.

 The HT-29 cell line was most susceptible to the compounds tested.

 Squalene (1) and polyprenol (2) were most cytotoxic against HT-29 (IC50 of 0.84 and 1.059 g/mL, respectively), followed by MCF7 (IC50 of 4.404 and 3.786 g/mL, respectively), and HCT-116 (IC50 of 7.859 and 9.258 g/mL, respectively).

 Triglycerides (3) was highly anti-proliferative against HT-29 cells (IC50 of 2.738 g/mL) and moderately inhibitory against HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells (IC50 of 13.05 and 16.12 g/mL, respectively). -Sitosterol (4) was most cytotoxic against HT29 and MCF-7 (IC50 of 1.41 and 2.277 g/mL, respectively) and moderately cytotoxic against HCT-116 (IC50 of 11.63 g/mL).

 Comparing the cytotoxic effects of these compounds against the three cancer cell lines, 1-4 were most cytotoxic against HT-29.

 Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were less inhibitory to MCF-7 and least inhibitory to HCT-116.

 Comparing the effects of 1-4 on the two colon cancer cell lines, their IC50 values against HT-29 were lower than those of HCT-116.

 Compounds 1-4 showed moderate cytotoxicity against HDFn cells (11.18 to 17.72 g/mL) and were less cytotoxic to the normal cells than the cancer cells.

Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum (A. Juss.) Miq of the family Meliaceae may be found in thickets and primary and secondary lowland forests up to 1,800 m asl in many parts of the Philippines where it is locally known as igyo, and in other Malesian regions down to Samoa.

 Commonly known as ivory mahogany, the mature plant may be used as a general purpose timber.

 In traditional folk medicine, decoction of chopped leaves and bark are used to treat coughs, skin irritations, body aches, lung hemorrhage, and sexually transmitted diseases and are also used to induce vomiting after food poisoning,4. In addition, it was reported that the juice extracted from the leaves may be used as an early abortifacient.

 In another study, the plants bark yielded four new compounds, dysoxylins AD, belonging to the tetranortriterpenoid family, which demonstrated strong bioactivity against anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)6,7. Structure elucidation of isolates from hexane and choloroform extracts of the plants stem bark yielded p-hydroxyacetophenone, -sitosterol, and stigmasterol.

 A new limonoid, gaudichaudysolin A, isolated from the plants bark, was evaluated in vitro for its cytotoxic effects against five human cancer cell lines: HL60 (human blood premyelocytic leukemia), RPMI (multiple myeloma), NCI-H226 (non-small cell lung carcinoma), HCT116 (human colon cancer), and MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells.

 This study was conducted as part of our research on the chemical constituents of the genus Dysoxylum found in the Philippines.

 We earlier reported the isolation of new glabretal-type triterpenoids along with the known Mariquit et al. /Cytotoxic Compounds from IJPPR, Volume 8, Issue 4: April 2016 Page 669 compounds, 24,25-epoxy-3,23-dihydroxy-7-tirucallene, squalene, polyprenol, linoleic acid and lutein from the leaves of Dysoxylum mollissimum Blume.

 Recently, we reported that the crude dicloromethane leaf extract of Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum (A. Juss.) Miq exhibited IC50 values of 7.35 and 13.19 g/mL against breast cancer (MCF-7) and colon cancer (HT-29) cells, respectively.

 Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane leaf extract led to the isolation of squalene (1), polyprenols (2), triglycerides (3), and -sitosterol (4)11.

 We report herein Figure 1: Chemical structures of squalene (1), polyprenols (2), triglycerides (3), and -Sitosterol (4) from the leaves of D. gaudichaudianum.

 Each plot shows the effect of 1-4 and Zeocin against each cell line.

 Data shown are means of triplicates.

 GraphPad Prism 6.07 was used to perform extra sum-of-squares F test to (A) evaluate if the best-fit parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) differs among data sets (treatments), and (B) determine the differences among the dose-response curve fits.

 The results are: MCF-7 (A) F (DFn, DFd) = F (5, 124) = 3.864, p = 0.0027 and (B) F (10, 124) = 5.384, p < 0.0001; HCT-116 (A) F (5, 116) = 9.586, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (10, 116) = 5.080, p < 0.0001; HT-29 (A) F (5, 124) = 5.644, p = 0.0001 and (B) F (10, 124) = 6.194, p < 0.0001; HDFn (A) F (5, 124) = 11.35, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (10, 124) = 6.025, p < 0.

 Mariquit et al. /Cytotoxic Compounds from IJPPR, Volume 8, Issue 4: April 2016 Page 670 the cytotoxicity studies on 1-4 (Figure 1) isolated from the leaves of D. gaudichaudianum.

 To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the IC50 values of 2 and 3 against breast and colon cancers.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Collection Samples of leaves and twigs of Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum (A. Juss.) Miq were collected from the De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex (DLSU-STC) riparian forest in February 2014.

 The samples were authenticated and deposited at the De La Salle University Herbarium with voucher specimen #920.

 Isolation and Structure Elucidation The isolation and structure elucidation of 1-4 from the leaves of D. gaudichaudianum were reported previously.

 Preparation of Compounds for Cytotoxicity Tests The compounds (1-4) from D. gaudichaudianum were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 4 mg/mL stock solution.

 Working solutions were prepared in complete growth medium to a final non-toxic DMSO concentration of 0.

1%.

 Maintenance and Preparation of Cell Lines for Cytotoxicity Tests The cytotoxicity of 1-4 from the dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) extracts from D. gaudichaudianum was tested on the following human cell lines: breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer (HCT-116 and HT-29; ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, U.S.A.), and human dermal fibroblast, neonatal (HDFn; Invitrogen Life Technologies, U.S.A.), which are routinely maintained at the Cell and Tissue Culture Laboratory, Molecular Science Unit, Center for Natural Science and Environmental Research, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines.

 Following standard procedures,13, cells were grown in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) and 1x antibioticantimycotic (Gibco, USA) and kept in an incubator (37C, 5% CO2, 98% humidity).

 At 80% confluence, the monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, Gibco, USA), trypsinized with 0.05% Figure 3: Dose-response curves showing the cytotoxic activities of 1-4 and Zeocin on the cell viability of MCF-7, HCT-116, HT-29 and HDFn.

 Each plot shows the effect of a compound against all cell lines tested.

 Data shown are means of triplicates.

 GraphPad Prism 6.07 was used to perform extra sum-of-squares F test to (A) evaluate if the bestfit parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) differs among data sets (treatments), and (B) determine the differences among the dose-response curve fits.

 The results are: compound 1 (A) F (DFn, DFd) = F (3, 88) = 39.06, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (6, 88) = 19.64, p < 0.0001; compound 2 (A) F (3, 80) = 30.83, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (6, 80) = 15.61, p < 0.0001; compound 3 (A) F (3, 88) = 3.711, p = 0.0145 and (B) F (6, 88) = 3.797, p = 0.0021; compound 4 (A) F (3, 88) = 10.27, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (6, 88) = 5.419, p < 0.

 Mariquit et al. /Cytotoxic Compounds from IJPPR, Volume 8, Issue 4: April 2016 Page 671 Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, USA) and resuspended with fresh complete media.

 Cells were counted following standard trypan blue exclusion method using 0.4% Trypan Blue Solution (Gibco, USA).

 Cells were seeded in 100-L aliquots into 96-well microtiter plates (FalconTM, USA) using a final inoculation density of 1 x 104 cells/well.

 The plates were further incubated overnight (37C, 5% CO2, 98% humidity) until complete cell attachment was reached.

 These cells were used for the cytotoxicity studies as described below.

 Cell Viability Assay The cytotoxicity of the D. gaudichaudianum compounds was determined in a cell viability assay using PrestoBlue (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA).

 This test is based on the presence of mitochondrial reductase in viable cells which then reduces the resazurin dye (blue and nonfluorescent) in the reagent to resorufin (red and highly fluorescent).

 The conversion is proportional to the number of metabolically active cells and is determined quantitatively using absorbance measurements.

 To the monolayers in the microtiter plate, 100 L of filtersterilized 1-4 were added to corresponding wells at twofold serial dilutions to make final screening concentrations of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 g/mL.

 The treated cells were further incubated (37C, 5% CO2, 98% humidity) for 4 days.

 Ten microliters of PrestoBlue was added to each well.

 The cells were incubated (37C, 5% CO2, 98% humidity) for 2 hr.

 Wells with no compound added served as negative controls while wells with ZeocinTM (Gibco, USA) served as positive controls.

 Wells containing cell culture media only were used to correct for background absorbance.

 Absorbance measurements were carried out using BioTek ELx800 Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., U.S.A.) at 570 nm and normalized to 600 nm values (reference wavelength).

 Absorbance readings were used to calculate for the cell viability for each sample concentration following the equation below. (%) = ( ) ( ) 100 Nonlinear regression and statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 6.07 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to extrapolate the half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 (the concentration of the compound which resulted in a 50% reduction in cell viability).

 The cytotoxicity of 1-4 was expressed as IC50 values.

 All tests were performed in triplicates and data were shown as means.

 The extra sumof-squares F test was used to evaluate the differences in the best-fit parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) among data sets (treatments) and to determine the differences among dose-response curve fits according to the softwares recommended approach.

 One-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) was also used to determine significant differences among treatments, followed by Tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test (p < 0.05), to compare different pairs of data sets.

 Results were considered significant at p < 0.

 RESULTS AND DISCUSION This work presents studies on the cytotoxic activities of squalene (1), polyprenol (2), triglycerides (3), and sitosterol (4), previously isolated from the dichloromethane extracts of D. gaudichaudianum leaves, against three human cancer cell lines, breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and a human normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast, neonatal (HDFn).

 A known anti-cancer drug, Zeocin, was used as positive control.

 The % cell viability as a function of the logarithmic values of compound concentration is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Most plots nearly follow the typical sigmoidal curve which is characteristic of an inhibitory dose-response relationship between treatments and cell viability.

 Figure 2 compares the anti-proliferative effects per cell line, while Figure 3 compares the effects per compound.

 The corresponding IC50 values are summarized in Table 1. The breast cancer cell line (MCF7) is most susceptible to 4, 2, and 1 with IC50 values of 2.277, 3.786, and 4.404 g/mL, respectively, and least susceptible to 3 with an IC50 value of 16.12 g/mL.

 Oneway ANOVA showed that all treatments are statistically different (p < 0.0001), but Tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test revealed that there are no pairwise differences between 1 and 2, 1 and Zeocin, 2 and 4, and 2 and Zeocin (p > 0.

05).

 The colon cancer cell line (HCT-116) is most susceptible to 1 and 2 with IC50 values of 7.859 and 9.258 g/mL, respectively, followed by 4 and 3 with IC50 values of 11.63, and 13.05 g/mL, respectively.

 One-way ANOVA showed that all treatments are statistically different (p < 0.0001), but Tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test showed pairwise differences only between 1 and 4 (p < 0.0001), and 2 and 3 (p < 0.

 Results of the Tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test are discussed in this section.

 Mariquit et al. /Cytotoxic Compounds from IJPPR, Volume 8, Issue 4: April 2016 Page 672 the other colon cancer cell line (HT-29) exhibited the strongest inhibition at the lowest concentrations of the compounds, with IC50 values of 0.84, 1.059, 1.41, 2.738 g/mL for 1, 2, 4 and 3, respectively.

 Tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test showed statistical differences between all treatments except for 4 and Zeocin (p > 0.

05).

 The normal cell line, HDFn, responded moderately to all the compounds, with IC50 values of 11.18, 12.4, 17.01, and 17.72 g/mL for 4, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

 The pairs of compounds, 1 and 4, and 2 and 3 are not statistically different (p > 0.

05).

 Data analysis showed statistical differences in the best-fit parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) among treatments and among the dose-response curve fits (Figures 2 and 3).

 Overall, comparing the three human cancer cell lines, HT-29 showed the most cytotoxic response to the compounds tested (IC50 value of 0.84 g/mL for squalene (1)).

 This was followed by MCF-7 cells (IC50 values of 2.77 and 3.786 g/mL for -sitosterol (4) and polyprenol (2), respectively).

 In a preliminary study on the cytotoxic activity of the dichloromethane extract of D. gaudichaudianum leaves, the crude extract exhibited cytotoxic activities with IC50 values of 13.19 and 7.35 g/mL for HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cells, respectively.

 In the current study, the isolated compounds from the extract exhibited high anti-proliferative activities against the cell lines used, indicating that these compounds may be responsible for the cytotoxicity of the extract.

 Among the cancer cell lines tested, HCT-116 showed the least response to the compounds.

 On the other hand, the normal cell line, HDFn, exhibited moderate susceptibility only.

 The most cytotoxic effect was seen in HT-29 cells using squalene (1), while the least anti-proliferative effect was observed in MCF-7 cells treated with triglycerides (3).

 Overall, 1-4 showed varying, but promising cytotoxic properties.

 The US National Cancer Institute has defined the active cytotoxic limits of natural products as 20 g/mL or less for crude extracts and 4 g/mL or less for pure compounds.

 Pure compounds that exhibit active cytotoxicity may have some potential for drug development.

 The results showed that 1-4 from the dichloromethane extracts of D. gaudichaudianum leaves can be further developed for the treatment of human colorectal type and human breast cancers.

 The study also showed that the cytotoxic activity of 1-4 was a function of the specific type of cancer cells targeted.

 When the two colon cancer cell lines are compared, the IC50 values of 14 for HT-29 were lower than HCT-116, implying that the former could be more responsive to anti-cancer treatments using the compounds tested.

 It was reported that variances in the expression profiles of several genes associated with drug sensitivity between HCT-116 and HT-29 could influence the cells response to different inhibitory compounds.

 A related study using four human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29, HCT-15, and KM-12) revealed that gene expression profiling after inhibition of signal transduction by 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin, a known inhibitor of the hsp90 molecular chaperone, could explain how cells respond under different treatment conditions.

 Previous studies revealed that squalene, polyprenols, triglycerides, and sitosterol exhibited cytotoxic and anticancer properties.

 Squalene (1) was reported to exhibit antitumor activities against colon cancer in rodents.

 It was also found to remarkably control colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and crypt multiplicity in laboratory rats which supported the hypothesis that it possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis.

 In a study evaluating the anti-proliferative effects of tocotrienols, carotenoids, squalene, and coenzyme Q10 from palm oil against two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, it was found that there was a suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-B) protein in the breast cancer cells exposed briefly to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)19,20.

 The protective and therapeutic effects of squalenecontaining compounds on the promotion of tumor cells have been reported.

 Relevant reviews on the bioactive properties of squalene have been provided,23.

 Thus, 1 was reported to exhibit cytotoxic properties against colon and breast cancer cells which corroborate our findings that 1 showed high cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells, HT29 and HCT-116, and breast cancer cells, MCF-7, with IC50 values of 0.84, 7.859 and 4.404 g/mL, respectively.

 Polyprenols (2) from Ginkgo biloba L. showed hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-stimulated hepatotoxicity in rats and exhibited antitumor activity.

 Polyprenols inhibited Heps, S (180) and EC transplanted tumors by at least 50%25.

 Polyprenol, with concentrations between 103-104 M, induced apoptosis in multidrug-resistant MCF-7 cells by reducing the resistance marker, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in the plasma membrane.

 In a related study, MCF-7 cells treated with 104 M of polyprenol resulted in the downregulation of DPAGT overexpression which led to the regulation of E-cadherin expression, an important factor in the prevention of tumors and metastasis.

 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the cytotoxicity of 2 against colon cancer cells HT-29 and HCT116 and breast cancer cells MCF-7, with IC50 values of 1.059, 9.258 and 3.786 g/mL, respectively.

 Triacylglycerols (3) from Tuna (1000 mg/kg) was reported to significantly inhibit the tumor growth in the spleen of mice with intrasplenically-implanted Lewis lung carcinoma.

 Triacylglycerols, which account for 1220% of the total seed weight of pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) extract, was found to significantly decrease cell viability in two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-729.

 To our knowledge, this is the first report on the cytotoxicity of 3 against colon cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT116, and breast cancer cells, MCF-7, with IC50 values of 2.738, 13.05, and 16.12 g/mL, respectively. -Sitosterol (4) was found to affect the programmed cell death pathway in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and human adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231), hindering tumor growth by promoting apoptosis.

 It also inhibited cell proliferation of human colon cancer cells (HT-29)31. -Sitosterol (4) inhibited the growth of HT116 human colon cancer cells by different mechanisms including the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, accompanied by proteolytic cleavage of Mariquit et al. /Cytotoxic Compounds from IJPPR, Volume 8, Issue 4: April 2016 Page 673 poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase and the reduction of the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and mRNA and a subsequent increase of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein and mRNA.

 In vitro studies showed that 4 inhibited the proliferation of human colon cancer cells (COLO 320 DM) with an IC50 of 266.

 M, inducing apoptosis by scavenging oxidants and attenuating -catenin and PCNA expression while in vivo studies showed that 4 reduced the number of aberrant crypt and crypt multiplicity in DMHinitiated rats in a dose-dependent fashion. -Sitosterol (4) significantly decreased the expression of NiemannPick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) in human small intestine epithelial cells (FHs 74 Int), reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption at the cellular level.

 It also promoted apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of Akt in murine fibrosarcoma cells (MCA-102)35.

 It was reported that 4 and stigmasterol exhibited anti-proliferative activities against human prostate cancer cells (DU-145) by increasing the expression of p53 protein and inhibiting carcinoma development by decreasing the expression of p21 and p27 proteins.

 Thus, 4 was reported to exhibit cytotoxic properties against several cancer cell lines such as colon and breast cancer cell lines which corroborate our findings that 4 showed high cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells, HT-29, and breast cancer cells, MCF-7, with IC50 values of 1.41 and 2.277 g/mL, respectively..

Squalene (1), polyprenols (2), triglycerides (3), and sitosterol (4), isolated from the dichloromethane extract of Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum leaves, exhibited varying cytotoxic activities against three human cancer cell lines, breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and a normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast, neonatal (HDFn).

 The anti-proliferative activities of 1-4 were highest against HT-29, with IC50 values ranging from 0.84 to 2.738 g/mL, followed by MCF-7, with IC50 values ranging from 2.277 to 16.12 g/mL, and HCT-116, with IC50 values ranging from 7.859 to 13.05 g/mL.

 All compounds (1-4) were moderately cytotoxic against HDFn with IC50 values >10 g/mL.

 Overall, 1-4 were more cytotoxic to the breast and colon cancer cell lines than to the normal cell line..
