ABSTRACT 
 
Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the flowers of Duranta erecta L. has led to the isolation of 
oleanolic acid (1), a mixture of ?-amyrin (2a) and ?-amyrin (2b) in a 3:1 ratio, phytyl fatty acid esters (3), and 
triacylglycerols (4), The structures of 1-4b were identified by comparison of their NMR data with literature data.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Duranta erecta L. (syn. D. repens L.) of the family Verbenaceae is  an ornamental plant which originated fom South 
America [1,2].   In Chinese medicine, the fruits were used for treatment of malaria and the leaves are employed for 
the treatment of abscesses [3]. The leaves of D. erecta yielded iridoid glucosides, duranterectosides A, B, C and D, 
durantosides I and II, lamiide, lamiidoside and verbascoside. Duranterectoside A durantosides I, II and III, and 
lamiidoside were also isolated from the stems [4]. The leaves of D. repens yielded durantoside IV, durantoside V, 
oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, (E)-cinnamic acid, ?-sitosteryl-3-O-?-D-glucopyranoside, (E)-p-methoxycinnamic acid, 
kusaginin, glucose, durantoside I, and durantoside II [5]. The chloroform extract of stem and ethanol extract of fruits 
exhibited potent antishigellosis activity and moderate activity against some pathogenic bacteria and fungi.  A 
mixture of ?-amyrin and 12-oleanene 3?, 21?-diol from these extracts showed mild to moderate antimicrobial ativity 
[6].  Phenylethanoid glycoside acteoside, the iridoid lamiide and the saponin pseudo-ginsenoside-RT1 were isolated 
from the methanol extract of D. repens. Acteoside showed an IC50 of 3.05 +/- 0.09 µg/mL in the DPPH assay, while 
lamiide and pseudo- ginsenoside-RT1 were inactive [7].  The leaves of D. repens yielded durantanin IV and V, a 
bidesmosidic saponin, oleanolic acid, three phenylethanoids and five flavonoids [8].  Another study reported the 
isolation of the flavonoids 3,7,4?-trihydroxy-3?-(4-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-5,6-dimethoxyflavone,3,7-dihydroxy-3?-
(4-hydroxy-3-methylbuty l)-5,6,4?-trimetho xyflavone and diterpenes 6?-hydroxy-15,16-epoxy-5?,8?,9?,10?-
cleroda-3,13(16),14-trien-18-oic acid and 2?-hydroxy-15,16-epoxy-5?,8?,9?,10?-cleroda-3,13,14-trien-18-oic acid 
from D. repens [9]. Furthermore, 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3-?-ol, naringenin, 3,4-dihydroxy-?-phenethyl-O-?-

rhamnopyranosyl-4-O-caffeoyl-?-D-glucopyranosid, lamiide, ?-glucopyranosyl-?-fructopyrano side, and ?-
galactopyranosyl-?-glucopyranosyl-fructopyranoside were isolated from the ethanol extract of D. repens. The 
petroleum ether extract afforded a mixture of hydrocarbons ranging from C15 - C27, fatty acids methyl esters and 
fatty acids with palmitic acid as the main component (46%) [10].   Moreover, trans-cinnamic acid was isolated from 
the methanol extract of the fruits of D. repens [11].  
 
In this study, we report the isolation of oleanolic acid (1), a mixture of ?-amyrin (2a) and ?-amyrin (2b), phytyl fatty 
acid esters (3), and triacylglycerols (4) from the flowers of D. erecta. The structures of 1-4  are presented in Fig. 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
General Experimental Procedure 
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl3 at 600 MHz for 
1H NMR and 150 MHz 
for 13C NMR spectra. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer 
chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized 
by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming. 
 
Sample Collection 
Samples of the flowers of Duranta erecta were collected from Sta Rosa, Laguna, Plippines in January 2015. The 
samples were authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum. 
 
General Isolation Procedure 
A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography. The crude 
extracts were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% 
increment by volume as eluents. Five milliliter fractions were collected. All fractions were monitored by thin layer 
chromatography. Fractions with spots of the same Rf  values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate

solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained. Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as 
columns. One milliliter fractions were collected. 
 
Isolation of the chemical constituents from the Flowers of Duranta erecta 
The air-dried D. erecta flowers (70 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered. The 
solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (1.86 g) which was chromatographed using 
increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 in 10% increments by volume. The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was 
rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether.  The less polar fractions were combined and 
rechromatographed using  7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 3 (4 mg). The more polar fractions were 
combined and rechromatographed using  7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 4 (5 mg).  The 30% acetone in 
CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed  (2 ×)  using  15% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of 2a and 
2b (6 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.  The 90% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ×) 
using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9, v/v) to afford 1 (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of D. erecta yielded 1–4b.  The NMR spectra 
of 1 are in accordance with data reported in the literature for olenolic acid [12]; 2a for ?-amyrin [13]; and 2b for ?-
amyrin  [13]; 3 for phytyl fatty acid esters [14]; and 4 for triacylglycerols [15].  The 3:1 ratio of the mixture of ?-
amyrin (2a) and ?-amyrin (2b) was deduced from the integrations and intensities of the 1H NMR resonances for the 
olefinic protons of 2a at ? 5.24 (t, J = 3.6 Hz, H-12) and 2b at ? 5.27 (t, J = 3.6 Hz, H-12) [13].
