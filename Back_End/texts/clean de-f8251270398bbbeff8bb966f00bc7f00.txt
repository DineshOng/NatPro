Locsin Campus, Binan City, Laguna 4024, Philippines . . Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the flowers of Duranta erecta L. has led to the isolation of oleanolic acid (1), a mixture of alpha-amyrin (2a) and beta-amyrin (2b) in a 3:1 ratio, phytyl fatty acid esters (3), and triacylglycerols (4), The structures of 1-4b were identified by comparison of their NMR data with literature data. Keywords: Duranta erecta, Verbenaceae, oleanolic acid, phytyl fatty acid esters, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, triacylglycerols . . Duranta erecta L. (syn. D. repens L.) of the family Verbenaceae is an ornamental plant which originated fom South America . In Chinese medicine, the fruits were used for treatment of malaria and the leaves are employed for the treatment of abscesses . The leaves of D. erecta yielded iridoid glucosides, duranterectosides A, B, C and D, durantosides I and II, lamiide, lamiidoside and verbascoside. Duranterectoside A durantosides I, II and III, and lamiidoside were also isolated from the stems . The leaves of D. repens yielded durantoside IV, durantoside V, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, (E)-cinnamic acid, beta-sitosteryl-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, (E)-p-methoxycinnamic acid, kusaginin, glucose, durantoside I, and durantoside II . The chloroform extract of stem and ethanol extract of fruits exhibited potent antishigellosis activity and moderate activity against some pathogenic bacteria and fungi. A mixture of beta-amyrin and 12-oleanene 3beta, 21beta-diol from these extracts showed mild to moderate antimicrobial ativity . Phenylethanoid glycoside acteoside, the iridoid lamiide and the saponin pseudo-ginsenoside-RT1 were isolated from the methanol extract of D. repens. Acteoside showed an IC50 of 3.05 +/0.09 g/mL in the DPPH assay, while lamiide and pseudoginsenoside-RT1 were inactive . The leaves of D. repens yielded durantanin IV and V, a bidesmosidic saponin, oleanolic acid, three phenylethanoids and five flavonoids . Another study reported the isolation of the flavonoids 3,7,4'-trihydroxy-3'-(4-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-5,6-dimethoxyflavone,3,7-dihydroxy-3'(4-hydroxy-3-methylbuty l)-5,6,4'-trimetho xyflavone and diterpenes 6beta-hydroxy-15,16-epoxy-5beta,8beta,9beta,10alphacleroda-3,13(16),14-trien-18-oic acid and 2beta-hydroxy-15,16-epoxy-5beta,8beta,9beta,10alpha-cleroda-3,13,14-trien-18-oic acid from D. repens . Furthermore, 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3-alpha-ol, naringenin, 3,4-dihydroxy-beta-phenethyl-O-alpha Consolacion Y. Ragasa et al Der Pharmacia Lettre, 2016, 8 (19):234-236 . 235 Scholar Research Library rhamnopyranosyl-4-O-caffeoyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosid, lamiide, alpha-glucopyranosyl-alpha-fructopyrano side, and alphagalactopyranosyl-alpha-glucopyranosyl-fructopyranoside were isolated from the ethanol extract of D. repens. The petroleum ether extract afforded a mixture of hydrocarbons ranging from C15 C27, fatty acids methyl esters and fatty acids with palmitic acid as the main component (46%) . Moreover, trans-cinnamic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of the fruits of D. repens . In this study, we report the isolation of oleanolic acid (1), a mixture of alpha-amyrin (2a) and beta-amyrin (2b), phytyl fatty acid esters (3), and triacylglycerols (4) from the flowers of D. erecta. The structures of 1-4 are presented in Fig. . Fig. . Chemical structures of oleanolic acid (1), alpha-amyrin (2a) and beta-amyrin (2b), phytyl fatty acid esters (3), and triacylglycerols (4) from the flowers of D. erecta MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming. Sample Collection Samples of the flowers of Duranta erecta were collected from Sta Rosa, Laguna, Plippines in January 2015. The samples were authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National Museum. General Isolation Procedure A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography. The crude extracts were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment by volume as eluents. Five milliliter fractions were collected. All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography. Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate Consolacion Y. Ragasa et al Der Pharmacia Lettre, 2016, 8 (19):234-236 . 236 Scholar Research Library solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained. Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. One milliliter fractions were collected. Isolation of the chemical constituents from the Flowers of Duranta erecta The air-dried D. erecta flowers (70 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (1.86 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 in 10% increments by volume. The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether. The less polar fractions were combined and rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 3 (4 mg). The more polar fractions were combined and rechromatographed using 7.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 4 (5 mg). The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ) using 15% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of 2a and 2b (6 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. The 90% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ) using CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9, v/v) to afford 1 (3 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. . Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of D. erecta yielded 1-4b. The NMR spectra of 1 are in accordance with data reported in the literature for olenolic acid ; 2a for alpha-amyrin ; and 2b for betaamyrin ; 3 for phytyl fatty acid esters ; and 4 for triacylglycerols . The 3:1 ratio of the mixture of alphaamyrin (2a) and beta-amyrin (2b) was deduced from the integrations and intensities of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of 2a at 5.24 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-12) and 2b at 5.27 (t, J = 3. Hz, H-12) . . A research grant from the Science Foundation through the University Research Coordination Office of De La Salle University is gratefully acknowledged.
