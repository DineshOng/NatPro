INTRODUCTION
Hoya Br. is considered the largest genus of flowering 
plants in the family Apocynaceae. Commonly called 
wax plants due to the waxy appearance of their leaves 
and flowers, most species have ornamental value. A 
few have been reported to have medicinal properties 
or used in traditional medicine. In the Philippines, 
there are at least 109 species of Hoya; 88 of these 
are endemic to the country. One such endemic species 
is Hoya meliflua Merr. found in Apayao, Bataan, 
Laguna, La Union and Rizal in Luzon Island and in 
Leyte, Mindoro, Negros, Palawan and Panay islands in 
Central Philippines all at low altitudes.1 New records 
of occurrence in other provinces, such as Laguna, have 
not been published yet. The Plant List.2 states that 
H. meliflua is an unresolved name because some data 
suggest that it is synonymous with H. diversifolia Blume 
which is also found in other countries. This may be 
attributed to the confusion on the identity of the two 
Philippine native species.
This study is part of our research on the chemical 
constituents of Philippine native hoyas. We earlier 
reported the isolation of lupenone (I) and lupeol (II) 
from the roots; II, squalene (III) and ?-sitosterol 
(IV) from the leaves; and betulin (V) from the stems 
of H. mindorensis Schlechter.3 In another study, we 
reported the isolation of II, ?-amyrin (VI), ?-amyrin 
(VII), lupeol acetate (VIII), ?-amyrin acetate (IX) 
Triterpenes and Sterols from Leaves of Hoya meliflua Merr.
ABSTRACT
Introduction: Hoya plants are also called wax plants due to the waxy appearance of their 
leaves and flowers. Most species are cultivated as ornamental plants. In the Philippines, there 
are at least 109 species of Hoya; 88 of these are endemic to the country. One of the endemic 
species is Hoya meliflua often confused with H. diversifolia, which can also be found in other 
countries. This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of Philippine native 
Hoyas. Methods: The compounds were isolated by silica gel chromatography and identified 
by NMR spectroscopy. Results: Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract from 
the leaves of Hoya meliflua afforded squalene and mixtures of ?-amyrin (1a), ?-amyrin (1b) 
and lupeol (1c) in about 1:1:0.25 ratio; oleanone (2a), ursenone (2b) and lupenone (2c) in about 
1:1:0.3 ratio; ?-amyrin cinnamate (3a), ?-amyrin cinnamate (3b) and lupenyl cinnamate (3c) in 
about 0.5:0.3:1 ratio; and ?-sitosterol and stigmasterol in about 5:1 ratio. Conclusion: The 
results of our study indicate that Hoya meliflua shares similar chemical characteristics with 
other members of the genus Hoya. The triterpenes and sterols obtained from H. meliflua 
were also identified from other Hoya species. It is interesting to note that although most Hoya 
plants have no known biological activity and medicinal property, the compounds isolated from 
H. meliflua possess diverse bioactivities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
General Experimental Procedure 
Sample spectra were obtained on a JEOL ECS 400 spectrometer with 
CDCl3 as solvent. Column chromatography was performed, with silica 
gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer chromatography was performed with 
plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visual-
ized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.
Sample Collection
Hoya meliflua leaves and stems were collected from healthy vines of a 
clone that has been cultivated for more than 10 years. Samples labeled 
as PNRI-H.CA were provided under Material Transfer Agreement No. 
2016-004 dated June 24, 2016. The original plant came from Quezon 
Province, Philippines and authenticated by one of the authors (FBA).
General Isolation Procedure
A glass column 12 inches in height with 0.5 inch internal diameter 
was used for the fractionation of the crude extract. Fractions of 10 mL 
volumes were collected and monitored by thin layer chromatography. 
Fractions containing spots with similar Rf values were combined and 
rechromatographed using the appropriate solvent. Final purification was 
carried out using Pasteur pipette as the column, collecting 1 mL fractions. 
TLC-pure isolates were combined and after evaporation of the solvent, 
were subjected to NMR analysis.
Isolation of Chemical Constituents of the Leaves
The air-dried leaves (252.8 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 
for three days and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under 
vacuum to afford a crude extract (7.8 g) which was chromatographed by 
gradient elution with CH2Cl2, followed by increasing amounts of acetone 
at 10% increment by volume as eluents.
The CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 ×) using petroleum 
ether to afford squalene (12.8 mg). The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction 
was rechromatographed (3 ×) using 1% EtOAc in petroleum ether to 
yield a mixture of 3a, 3b and 3c (5.0 mg), after washing with petroleum 
ether. The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed 
(3 ×) using 2.5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield a mixture of 2a, 2b 
and 2c (10.3 mg), after washing with petroleum ether. The 30% acetone 
in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (4 ×) using 7.5% EtOAc in 
petroleum ether to afford a mixture of 1a, 1b and 1c (10.6 mg) after 
washing with petroleum ether. The 40% acetone in CH2Cl2 fractions was 
rechromatographed (3 ×) using 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield 
a mixture of ?-sitosterol and stigmasterol (21.0 mg) after washing with 
petroleum ether.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract from the 
leaves of Hoya meliflua afforded squalene and mixtures of ?-amyrin (1a), 
?-amyrin (1b) and lupeol (1c) in about 1:1:0.25 ratio; oleanone (2a), 
ursenone (2b) and lupenone (2c) in about 1:1:0.3 ratio; ?-amyrin cinna-
mate (3a), ?-amyrin cinnamate (3b) and lupenyl cinnamate (3c) in about 
0.5:0.3:1 ratio; and ?-sitosterol and stigmasterol in about 5:1 ratio. The 
structures of these compounds were identified by comparison of their 
NMR data with those reported in the literature.
The NMR spectra of 1a are in accordance with data reported in the 
literature for ?-amyrin,4 1b for ?-amyrin,4 1c for lupeol,4 2a for oleanone,15 
2b for ursenone,15 2c for lupenone,16 3a for ?-amyrin cinnamate,6,17 
3b for ?-amyrin cinnamate,6,17 3c for lupeol cinnamate,17 squalene,18 
?-sitosterol18 and stigmasterol.18 
The ratio of about 1:1:0.25 for the mixture of ?-amyrin (1a), ?-amyrin 
(1b) and lupeol (1c) was deduced from the intensities and integrations 
of the 1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of 1a at ? 5.16 (brs),7,12 
1b at ? 5.11 (brs)7,12 and 1c at ? 4.68 (brs) and 4.56 (brs).7,12,18 The ratio 
of about 1:1:0.30 for the mixture of oleanone (2a), ursenone (2b) and 
lupenone (2c) was deduced from the intensities and integrations of the 
1H NMR resonances for the olefinic protons of 2a at ? 5.19 (t, J = 3.2 
Hz),15 2b at ? 5.14 (t, J = 3.2 Hz)15 and 2c at ? 4.67 (brs) and 4.55 (brs).19 
The ratio of about 0.5:0.3:1 for the mixture of ?-amyrin cinnamate (3a), 
?-amyrin cinnamate (3b) and lupenyl cinnamate (3c) was deduced from 
the intensities and integrations of the 1H NMR resonances for the 
olefinic protons of 3a ? 5.18 (brs),6,17 3b at ? 5.13 (brs);6,17 and 3c at ? 
4.68 (br s) and 4.56 (br s).16 The ratio of about 5:1 for the mixture of 
?-sitosterol and stigmasterol was deduced from the intensities and 
integrations of the 1H NMR resonances for olefinic protons at ? 5.33 
(brs, H-5) and methyl protons at ? 0.66 (s) for ?-sitoterol and olefinic 
protons at ? 5.33 (brs, H-5), 5.13 (dd, J = 8.4, 15.2 Hz) and 5.00 
(dd, J = 8.4, 15.2 Hz) and the methyl protons at ? 0.68 (s) for stigmasterol.18
H. meliflua is cultivated as an ornamental plant in the Philippines. There 
is no reported biological activity and medicinal property for the plant, 
but Blanco20 mentioned as early as 1845 a record that H. meliflua causes 
“stoppage of birth,” or perhaps as an abortifacient. However, literature 
search revealed that the compounds isolated from the plant possess 
diverse activities.
?-Amyrin (1a) and ?-amyrin (1b) were reported to possess anti-inflam-
matory.21-23 and analgesic24-25 properties 
Triterpene 1a showed antifungal activity against A. rabiei with an MIC 
value of 0.0156 mg/mL,26 while 1b was proposed as a possible biomarker 
for the fungal resistance of grape-vine leaves (Vitis vinifera).27 The 
mixture of 1a and 1b effectively reduced the elevated plasma glucose 
levels during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Furthermore, the 
mixture of 1a and 1b at 100?mg/kg significantly decreased the VLDL 
and LDL cholesterol and increased the HDL cholesterol.28 A review on 
the sources and biological activities of 1a  and 1b has been provided.29

On the other hand, lupeol (1c) exhibited antiurolithiatic and diuretic 
activity.30 It prevented the formation of vesical calculi and reduced the 
size of the preformed stones in rats.31 It also showed antifungal activity 
against Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium notatum.32 Triterpene 1c 
significantly reduced the 451Lu tumor growth in athymic nude mice,33 
inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in 
a dose dependent manner34 and induced growth inhibition and apoptosis 
in hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC7721 cells by down- regulation of the 
death receptor 3 (DR3) expression.35 It exhibited potent anti-inflamma-
tory activity in an allergic airway inflammation model by a significant 
reduction in eosinophils infiltration and in Th2-associated cytokines 
levels that trigger the immune responses in asthma.36 Another study 
reported that 1c and lupeol acetate have shown hypotensive activity.37 
A review on the biological activities of lupeol has been provided.38 
Lupenone (2c) inhibited adipocyte differentiation by suppressing PPAR? 
and C/EBP? protein levels.39 It also increased the tyrosinase enzyme 
expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylated extra-
cellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation inhibition 
which results to stimulation of melanogenesis. This suggests that 2c 
could be a possible treatment for hypopigmentation.40
?-Amyrin cinnamate (3a) was reported to inhibit the TPAS-induced 
inflammation (ID50 0.27 ?mol/ear; CI 95% 0.23–0.33 ?mol/ear) which is 
more inhibitory than the positive control, indomethacin (ID50 0.91 ?mol/
ear  ;CI  95%  0.23–0.33 ?mol/ear).19 ?-Amyrin cinnamate (3b), lupeol 
cinnamate (3c) and 3a exhibited marked anti-inflammatory activity 
against TPA-induced inflammation (ID50 = 0.15–0.75 µmol/ear). 
Triterpene 3c showed the highest activity with ID50 of 0.15 µmol/ear.
12 
This triterpene at a dose of 10 mg/kg also exhibited anti-inflammatory 
activity on rat hind paw edema induced by carrageenan.12 Furthermore, 
3c exhibited inhibitory effect on skin tumor promotion in an in vivo 
two-stage carcinogenesis test using DMBA as an initiator and TPA as 
a promoter.12 Triterpenes 3a–3c showed moderate inhibitory effects on 
Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) in Raji cells as a primary 
screening test for inhibitors of tumor promoters.12
Squalene was reported to significantly suppress colonic ACF forma-
tion and crypt multiplicity which strengthened the hypothesis that it 
possesses chemopreventive activity against  colon carcinogenesis.41 It 
showed cardioprotective effect which is related to inhibition of lipid 
accumulation by its hypolipidemic properties and/or its antioxidant 
properties.42 A recent study reported that tocotrienols, carotenoids, 
squalene and coenzyme Q10 have anti-proliferative effects on breast 
cancer cells.43 The preventive and therapeutic potential of squalene 
containing compounds on tumor promotion and regression have been 
reported.44 A recent review on the bioactivities of squalene has been 
provided.45
?-Sitosterol was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human 
breast MCF-7 and MDA- MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells.46 It was shown 
to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.47 It was 
also reported to attenuate ?-catenin and PCNA expression, as well as 
quench radical in-vitro, making it a potential anticancer drug for colon 
carcinogenesis.48 It can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the entero-
cytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.49 It was reported to induce 
apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of 
Akt in MCA-t102 murine fibrosarcoma cells.50
Stigmasterol showed therapeutic efficacy against Ehrlich ascites carci-
noma bearing mice while conferring protection against cancer induced 
altered physiological conditions.51 It lowered plasma cholesterol levels, 
inhibited intestinal cholesterol and plant sterol absorption and suppressed 
hepatic cholesterol and classic bile acid synthesis in Winstar as well as 
WKY rats.52 Other studies reported that stigmasterol showed cytostatic 
activity against Hep-2 and McCoy cells,53 markedly inhibited tumour 
promotion in two stage carcinogenesis experiments,54 exhibited antimu-
tagenic,55 topical anti-inflammatory,56 antiosteoarthritic57 and antioxidant58 
activities.
CONCLUSION
The results of our study indicate that Hoya meliflua shares similar chemical 
characteristics with other members of the genus Hoya: H. multiflora,4 
H. diversifolia,7 H. cumingiana,8 and H. paziae12 which yielded ?-amyrin 
(1a) and ?-amyrin (1b); H. mindorensis,3 H. multiflora,4 H. diversifolia,7 
H. cumingiana,8 H. paziae,12 H. cagayanensis,13 and H. madulidii14 which 
contained lupeol (1c); H. mindorensis,3 H. pubicalyx,12 and H. cagaya-
nensis15 which afforded lupenone (2c); H. wayetii,5 H. buotii,6 and 
H. madulidii14 which yielded ?-amyrin cinnamate (3a); H. buotii,6 and 
H. madulidii14 which afforded ?-amyrin cinnamate (3b); H. diversifolia7 
and H. madulidii14 which provided lupenyl cinnamate (3c); H. mindorensis,3 
H. multiflora,4 H. wayetii,5 H. buotii,6 H. diversifolia,7 H. cumingiana,8 
H. pubicalyx,9,10 H. cagayanensis,13 and H. madulidii14 which contained 
?-sitosterol and stigmasterol; and H. mindorensis,3 H. buotii,6 H. diversi-
folia7 and H. madulidii14 which contained squalene. The most common 
constituents of the eleven native Hoya species studied are ?-sitosterol 
and stigmasterol which are found in ten species. Of the twelve 
compounds isolated from H. meliflua, lupeol is found in eight species, 
squalene, ?-amyrin and ?-amyrin in five species, lupenone and ?-amyrin 
cinnamate in four species, ?-amyrin cinnamate and lupenyl cinnamate 
in three species. Oleanone and ursenone are reported for the first time 
from Philippine Hoya species.
It is interesting to note that although most Hoya plants have no known 
biological activity and medicinal property, the compounds isolated from 
H. meliflua possess diverse bioactivities.
Lastly, the difference in results of phytochemical analysis of H. meliflua 
is a proof that it is an entirely different and distinct species from 
H. diversifolia.

GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT SUMMARY
• Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract from the leaves of Hoya 
meliflua afforded squalene and mixtures of ?-amyrin (1a), ?-amyrin (1b) and 
lupeol (1c) in about 1:1:0.25 ratio; oleanone (2a), ursenone (2b) and lupenone 
(2c) in about 1:1:0.3 ratio; ?-amyrin cinnamate (3a), ?-amyrin cinnamate (3b) 
and lupenyl cinnamate (3c) in about 0.5:0.3:1 ratio; and ?-sitosterol and stig-
masterol in about 5:1 ratio. The structures of these compounds were identified 
by comparison of their NMR data with those reported in the literature.
