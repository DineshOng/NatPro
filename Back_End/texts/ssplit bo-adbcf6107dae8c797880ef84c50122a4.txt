1239 broccoli, exhibited multiple chemo-preventive effects through the inhibition of androgen and estrogen related mechanisms and signaling pathways mediating the cell cycle.. The isothiocyanates commonly found in broccoli, sulforaphane and erucin, inhibited the expression of LasR, a transcriptional activator, through the disruption of quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

 Mammospheres or stem/progenitor cells from breast adenocarcinoma immortalized cell lines, MCF7 and SUM159, were treated with sulforaphane.

 Anti-proliferation of these cells was induced due to the decreased presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme activity.

 The major constituents of the essential oils in the seeds of Brassica juncea (L.) Coss., grown in Hebei, Shaanxi and Shandong Province were allyl isothiocyanate (61.3%), diallyl trisulfide (9.7%) and 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (5.9%).

Another study reported that B. juncea seed oil afforded beta-sitosterol, campesterol and brassicasterol.

The chemical constituents of B. juncea include glucosinolates, ascorbate, folate and sterols (brassicasterol, sitosterol and brassinosteroids).

Raphanus sativus (radish) sprouts and mature radish taproot contained glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, phenolics and anthocyanins.

The major fatty acids in seed lipids of radish were erucic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, while the major fatty acids in radish family lipids were linolenic acid (52-55%), erucic acid (30-33%), and palmitic acid (20-22%).

 This study was conducted on the dichloromethane extracts of the Brassica vegetables red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var capitata f. rubra L), green/white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.), broccoli (Brassica oleracea L var. italic), mustard (Brassica juncea) and radish (Raphanus sativus).

 Results of this study identified the relatively nonpolar constituents which may contribute to the anticancer properties of these vegetables.

 We report herein the sterols, triglycerides and essential fatty acid constituents of local collections of Brassica oleracea varieties, Brassica juncea and Raphanus sativus.

 Carotenoids were also isolated as the major constituents of Brassica juncea.

The dichloromethane extracts from the leaves of Brassica oleracea var capitata f. rubra L (red cabbage) and Brassica oleracea L (green/white cabbage) and the stem of Brassica oleracea L var itali (broccoli) afforded 1 and 2. The red cabbage also yielded 3, while the green/white cabbage and broccoli stem also yielded 4. The structures of 1, 2, 3 and 4 were identified by comparison of their 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature for betasitosterol , unsaturated triglyceride , stigmasterol and linoleic acid , respectively.

 The dichloromethane extracts of the leaves of Brassica juncea (mustard) and the roots of Raphanus sativus (radish) yielded 1 and the essential fatty acids, 4 and alpha-linolenic acid (6). Mustard leaves also afforded trilinolenin (5), lutein (7) and beta-carotene (8), while radish roots also yielded 2. The structures of 5, 6, 7 and 8 were identified by comparison of their 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature for trilinolenin , alpha-linolenic acid , lutein and beta-carotene , respectively.

 The presence of alpha-linolenic acid (6) in the triglyceride was deduced from the methyl triplet at 0.96 (t, J = 7. Hz), the double allylic methylenes at 2.78 and the olefinic protons at 5.34 (m).

The presence linoleic acid (4) Consolacion Y. Ragasa et al J. Chem.

 Pharm. Res., 2013, 5(12):1237-1243.

1241 was deduced from the methyl triplet at 0.86 (t, J = 6.6 Hz), the double allylic methylene at 2.8 and the olefinic protons at 5.34 (m).

Based on integrations of the triglyceride methyls at 0.96 (t, J = 7.8 Hz) and 0.86 (t, J = 6.6 Hz), the ratio of linolenic acid and linoleic acid in the triglycerides (2) of red cabbage and radish is about 1:1. On the other hand, the triglyceride in mustard is trilinolenin (5) based on the methyl resonance at 0.96 (t, J = 7.8 Hz).

No other methyl resonance in the shielded region of the spectrum was detected for the triglyceride in mustard.

 A mixture of alpha-linolenic acid (6) and linoleic acid (4) in a 1:1 ratio was deduced from the integrals of the methyl triplets at 0.96 (t, J = 7.8 Hz) and 0.86 (t, J = 7.2 Hz) for the fatty acids in red cabbage and radish.

 In mustard, a mixture of alpha-linolenic acid (6) and linoleic acid (4) in a 2:1 ratio was deduced from the integrals of the methyl triplets at 0.96 (t, J = 7.8 Hz) and 0.86 (t, J = 7.2 Hz) for the fatty acids.

 Although no biological activity tests were conducted on the isolated compounds, literature search revealed that these have several known bioactivities.

 It is interesting to note that 1-8 were all reported as anticancer compounds. beta-Sitosterol (1) was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human breast MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cells.

It was shown to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

It was also reported to attenuate beta-catenin and PCNA expression, as well as quench radical in-vitro, making it a potential anticancer drug for colon carcinogenesis.

It can inhibit the expression of NPC1L1 in the enterocytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.

It was reported to induce apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of Akt in MCA-102 murine fibrosarcoma cells.

On the other hand, stigmasterol (3) shows therapeutic efficacy against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma bearing mice while conferring protection against cancer induced altered physiological conditions.

A triglyceride, trilinolein exhibited protective effects against cardiovascular disorders.

It also inhibits ischemiainduced ventricular arrhythmias and it exhibits anti-oxidant effect.

It was also reported to inhibit the growth of human non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 and induce apoptosis in a doseand timedependent manner.

Another study reported that triglycerides showed a direct relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation.

 Trilinolenin (18:3; -3) (5) was toxic only after prolonged incubation.

Linoleic acid (4) belongs to the omega-6 fatty acids.

 It was reported to be a strong anticarcinogen in a number of animal models.

 It reduces risk of colon and breast cancer and lowers cardiovascular disease risk and inflammations.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (6), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis.

 They also showed anti-inflammatory effects.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition serve as two signaling pathways for the inhibitory effects of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on the human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell proliferation.

Another study reported that apoptosis of hepatoma cells was induced by the alpha-linolenic acidenriched diet which correlated with a decrease in arachidonate content in hepatoma cells and decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression.

gamma-Linolenic acid (GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) exhibited greater than 90% cytotoxicity between 500 M and 1 mM against all but two malignant micro-organ cultures tested in 5-10% serum. GLA and ALA killed tumor at concentrations of 2 mM and above in tests using 30-40% serum.

Dietary lutein (7), especially at 0.002%, inhibited tumor growth by selectively modulating apoptosis, and by inhibiting angiogenesis.

Another study reported that the chemopreventive properties of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and lutein may be attributed to their differential effects on apoptosis pathways in normal versus transformed mammary cells.

A previous study reported that very low amounts of dietary lutein (0.002%) can efficiently decrease mammary tumor development and growth in mice.

beta-carotene (8) dose-dependently induced apoptosis and cell differentiation in cultured leukemia cells, but not in normal cells.

Another study reported that beta-carotene could reduce damage caused by radiation therapy and decrease local cancer recurrence.

It also inhibited angiogenesis by altering the cytokine profile and the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors.

The dichloromethane extracts of Brassica vegetables (red cabbage, green cabbage, broccoli and mustard) and radish afforded similar major constituents: beta-sitosterol, unsaturated triglycerides and essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acids) which were reported to exhibit anticancer properties.

 Thus, the anticancer properties of Brassica vegetables and radish are not only attributed to the high content of glucosinolates, but also to the presence of sterols, unsaturated triglycerides and essential fatty acids.
