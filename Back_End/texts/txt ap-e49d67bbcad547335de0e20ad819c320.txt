ABSTRACT 
The anti-venom activity of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees roots (APR) dichloromethane crude extracts 
and a promising APR constituent, skullcapflavone I (SKI) was investigated by monitoring the inhibition of secretory 
phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) of Naja philippinensis Taylor venom (NPV) crystallized samples. Gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry was used for the characterization of extracts, while molecular docking was utilized to understand 
anti-venom properties. Chromatographic analyses primarily revealed the presence of methoxylated flavones. NPV was 
found to have sPLA2 activity (0.0796 ± 0.0018 ?mol/minutes/ml) that has been attributed to the poisonous effects. 
SKI (IC50: 51.1 ± 3.5 ?g/ml), isolated from APR showed strong inhibitory effect on phospholipase activity compared 
with dichloromethane extracts of APR (IC50: 192.7 ± 10.9 ?g/ml) indicating that SKI was the cause of the bioactivity 
in APR. Molecular docking simulations showed corresponding results with highly negative binding energies (?6.59 to 
?8.72 kcal/mol) predicted for the binding of SKI to PLA2 proteins. An important trend found was the presence of free 
bound Ca2+ lowered binding energies signifying that Ca2+ a has role in the binding of the SKI to PLA2 proteins. The 
anti-venom property of APR and the pure compound SKI, upon further studies, could be the first line of defense in the 
medical protocol of snake venom neutralization.
INTRODUCTION
According to the World Health Organization (by appeal 
of numerous UN member countries), snake envenomation was 
listed as the highest priority (Category A) of neglected tropical 
disease on July 2017 (Chippaux, 2017). It was estimated that 
5.4 million snake bites result annually with subsequent 1.8–2.7 
million cases of poisoning (Gutiérrez et al., 2017). Mortality rates 
due to snake bite poisoning is from 81,410 to 137,880 yearly and 
the incidence of permanent disabilities and limb amputations are 
three times as much as morbidity (Gutiérrez et al., 2017). Highly 
affected are those in communities where access to medical health 
care and production of anti-venom immunoglobulins (ASVS) with 
appropriate immunogens is difficult, especially in marginalized 
rural areas in low- and middle-income households (Gutiérrez 
et al., 2017).
Cytotoxins of snake venom comprise nucleases, 
which hydrolyze and modify the activity of membrane-bound 
phosphodiester bonds of DNA, phospholipases, and enzymes 
(Naeem, 2017). The multiplex of venom components is able 
to depolarize excitable membranes which in turn hydrolyze 
phosphodiester bonds, heart cells, and neurons which manifests as 
hemolysis, cytotoxicity, and of disruption of the nervous system 
(Naeem, 2017). Venom proteases can degrade physiological 
substrates such as casein, hemoglobin, and fibrinogen which can 
manifest neurotoxic, myotoxic, cytolytic, edematic, cardiotoxic,

and anticoagulant effects (Fatima and Fatah, 2014). Short 
neurotoxin 1 was isolated from and found to be the major lethal 
component of Naja philippinensis Taylor or the Philippine spitting 
cobra (Hauert et al., 1974).
Since ASVS is not readily available in all hospitals 
whether private or public, victims would sometimes require 
transportation to specific facilities such as the Research Institute 
of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in the Philippines. In such case, 
an immediate response is hampered which is essential since 
neurotoxicity can occur after 60 minutes after incidence depending 
on the virility and inoculation of envenomation (Brunda and 
Sashidhar, 2007).
Plant inhibitors of snake venom have been reported 
to behave as antitoxins in envenomings (Soares et al., 2005). 
The “king of bitters,” Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees, 
has been used for centuries to treat a variety of diseases such as 
respiratory infections, fever, herpes, sore throat and a variety of 
other chronic and infectious diseases (Gupta et al., 1990). Its 
major constituents are diterpenoids, flavonoids, and polyphenols 
(Chao and Lin, 2010). Our earlier research reported the isolation of 
14-deoxy-12-hydroxyandrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide, 
and 14-deoxy-11,12-dihydroandrographolide from the leaves 
of A. paniculata (Ragasa et al., 2008). We also reported the 
isolation of andrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide, 
14-deoxy-12-hydroxyandrographolide, ?-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 
and chlorophyll a from the leaves; ?-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 
5,2?-dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone, long chain trans-cinnamate 
esters, and ?-sitosteryl fatty acid esters from the roots; ?-sitosterol, 
monogalactosyl diacylglycerols, lupeol, and triacylglycerols from 
the pods; and 14-deoxyandrographolide from the stems of A. 
paniculata (Tan et al., 2016).
In this work, we established the phospholipase activity 
of N. philippinensis venom and the anti-venom activities of the 
dichloromethane crude extracts A. paniculata roots (APR) and a 
constituent isolated from APR, skullcapflavoneI, or 5,2?-dihydroxy-
7,8-dimethoxyflavone (SKI), through a commercial phospholipase 
activity assay kit using crystallized N. philippinensis venom. 
Chemical characterization of the crude extracts was done through 
gas chromatography-electron ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-
EI-MS). Molecular docking simulations were performed between 
SKI to a phospholipase structure (PLA2) from Naja sp. acquired 
from the protein data bank (PDB) to analyze binding affinities and 
possible stereochemical noncovalent bonding. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first reported study using this methodology 
of gas chromatographic analyses, secretory phospholipase A2 
(sPLA2) activity, and docking and cluster analyses (PLA2 with 
SKI) against the aforementioned venom.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant material
Andrographis paniculata family Acanthaceae plants 
were grown and harvested from Bataan, Philippines. The plant 
was authenticated at the Botany Division, Philippine National 
Museum. Venom from N. philippinensis Taylor (NPV) in 
lyophilized (freeze-dried) form was procured from the RITM, 
Department of Health, Philippines.
Chemical extraction and GC-EI-MS characterization
The freeze-dried APR (~3 g) was ground in a blender, 
soaked in CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane) for a 24-hour interval, and 
then filtered to afford crude extracts (~38 mg) after subsequent 
concentration through the rotary evaporator. The dried extracts 
were dissolved in 1 ml of DCM for GC-EI-MS analyses. Structures 
derived were analyzed for peak area from the percent total of the 
sum of corrected areas. SKI was previously isolated as reported in 
a prior work (Tan et al., 2016).
An Agilent GC MS 7890B with a HP-5 ms (5% phenyl 
methyl siloxane) Ultra Inert column (30 m × 250 mm × 0.25 mm) 
with helium as a gas carrier was used for the triplicate analyses 
of the volatile constituents. The flow rate of the helium gas was 
set at 1.0587 ml/minutes, pressure was made to be at 9.4889 psi, 
with an average velocity of 37.862 cm/second and hold time of 
1.3206 minutes. The initial set point temperature was at 70°C. The 
program was as followed: first ramp was set at 2°C/minutes to 
135°C and held for 10 minutes, second ramp had a rate of 4°C/
minutes to 220°C and held for 10 minutes, and finall , the last 
ramp had a rate of 3.5°C/minutes to 270°C and held for 37 minutes.
Compound identification was done using the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library, 2.0 and 
peak areas (% of total) was processed from the resultant total 
ion chromatograms. The resultant data were confirmed by the 
comparison of the compounds according to their elution order 
with their relative retention indices on a non-polar stationary 
phase. The retention indices were computed for all the volatile 
constituents utilzing a homologous series of n-alkanes.
sPLA2 activity of N. philippinensis venom
The secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity of 
NPV was assessed using a commercially available kit (Secretory 
Phospholipase A2 Assay Kit Cat. No. ab133089) purchased from 
Abcam® (Cambridge, UK). PLA2 (EC 3.1.1.4) is responsible for 
the hydrolysis at the sn-2 position of phospholipids producing a 
lysophospholipid and a free fatty acid. The PLA-induced release 
of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids is believed to 
have a major role in the control of eicosanoid production in cells.
The components of the assay kit were prepared as 
indicated by the manufacturer. The kit includes the following: 
assay buffer (10×), 5,5?-dithio-bis-(2-nitro-benzoic acid) (DTNB), 
diheptanoyl thio-PC substrate, bee venom (control), and a 96-well 
polystyrene F-bottom clear microplate (Greener Bio One).
A 25 mM Tris-HCl containing 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM 
KCl, and 0.3 mM Triton X (pH 7.5) assay buffer was prepared by 
mixing 3 ml of the concentrate with 27 ml of high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade water. This buffer system 
(diluted assay buffer) was used to reconstitute the substrate and 
samples for the assay. Next, a vial of lyophilized DTNB was 
reconstituted with 1.0 mM of HPLC-grade water to make 10 mM 
DTNB in 0.4 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and was stored in the dark at 
0°C prior to use. For the diheptanoyl thio-PC buffer, the content 
of the vial was reconstituted with 12 ml of diluted assay buffer 
to make a final concentration of 1.66 mM. Lastly, bee venom 
(positive control) was prepared by dissolving an aliquot of bee 
venom sPLA2 standard with diluted assay buffer, which gives a 
final concentration of 100 ?g/ml. Likewise, NPV was dissolved 
Tan et al. / Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Science 9 (03); 2019: 073-081 075
in the diluted assay buffer to make a stock solution that gave a 
final concentration of 100 ?g/ml. All the sample components were 
prepared within the day of analysis, under controlled temperature 
and lighting, to avoid decomposition.
The sPLA2 activity of NPV was determined using a 
colorimetric assay in comparison with bee venom sPLA2 (positive 
control) and non-enzymatic controls (negative control). The 
components for the assay were carefully pipetted into a 96-well 
plate. The negative control wells consisted of 10 ?l DTNB and 15 
?l assay buffer, while the positive control wells consist of 10 ?l 
DTNB, 10 ?l bee venom PLA2 (100 ?g/ml final concentration), 
and 5 ?l assay buffer. The sample wells consist of 10 ?l DTNB, 
10 ?l NPV (100 ?g/ml final concentration), and 5 ?l assay buffer. 
The reaction was initiated by adding 200 ?l of substrate solution 
into each well, followed by colorimetric analysis using Corona 
Electric Multimode Microplate Reader (MTP-800, Corona 
Electric Co. Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) at an absorbance of 414 nm. The 
contents of the plate were homogenized using the mixing function 
at a medium speed for 5 seconds prior to absorbance reading. The 
reaction was monitored for a total of 30 minutes with absorbance 
reading per minute. The total volume per well was 225 ?l and the 
measurements were done in the triplicate. A linear increase in the 
absorbance was observed in the positive control and sample wells. 
The change in absorbance (?A414) per minute was calculated by 
plotting the absorbance values as a function of time to obtain the 
rate (slope). Likewise, the rate of ?A414 for the negative control 
was determined and subtracted from that of the positive and 
sample wells. The sPLA2 activity for bee venom and NPV were 
calculated using Eq. (1).

Inhibitory sPLA2 activity of APR and SKI
The inhibitory effects of APR and SKI isolated from 
A. paniculata were, respectively, determined against cobra venom 
sPLA2 using the assay kit described previously. The lyophilized 
samples were dissolved in methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) to prepare a 100 mg/ml stock solution. Aliquot portions 
were dissolved in DMSO to prepare various samples at a final
concentration ranging from 1 to 1,000 ?g/ml.
The negative control wells consist of 5 ?l DMSO, 10 ?l 
DTNB, and 10 ?l assay buffer, while the positive control wells 
consist of 5 ?l DMSO, 10 ?l DTNB, and 10 ?l NPV (100 ?g/ml 
final concentration). The sPLA2 activity of 100 ?g/ml NPV was 
monitored in the presence of the inhibitors APR and SKI. Seven 
concentrations of plant extracts ranging from 1 to 1,000 ?g/ml 
were tested against 100 ?g/ml NPV. The sample wells consisted of 
5 ?l inhibitor in DMSO, 10 ?l DTNB, and 10 ?l NPV (100 ?g/ml 
final concentration). The reaction was initiated by adding 200 ?l of 
substrate solution into each well, followed by colorimetric analysis 
using Corona Electric Multimode Microplate Reader (MTP-800, 
Corona Electric Co. Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) at an absorbance of 
414 nm. The inhibitory effect was determined by calculating the 
sPLA2 activity as described earlier using Eq. (1). In addition, the 
%inhibition was determined as shown in Eq. (2), based on the 
calculated sPLA2 activities. The concentration of extracts inducing 
50% inhibition (IC50) was also reported.

Computational methods
Several protein candidates which are known to be 
present in the venom of N. philippinensis: phospholipases, 
neurotoxins, and cardiotoxins were initially screened using 
Autodock Vina (Trott and Olsen, 2009). Top protein target 
candidates (PDB IDs: 1LN8, 1S6B, 1PSH, and 1A3F) from the 
screening were further analyzed using AutoDock 4.0 (Morris 
et al., 2009). The structure of SKI was docked into the candidates 
using Lamarkian Genetic Search algorithm. Blind docking was 
done by defining a grid box that encompasses the entire protein 
structure for each target. For each target, 200 independent GA 
runs with a population size of 150, 2,500,000 evaluations, and 
27,000 maximum generations. The 200 docking conformations 
of SKI were scored based on the calculated binding energy and 
clustered according to the root mean squared deviation for each 
target generation.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of dichloromethane extracts
GC-EI-MS analyses of the dichloromethane extracts of 
APR led to the identification of 16 constituents. The identified
components of the low-boiling point compounds of the crude 
extract were substantiated by retention index (RI) and structur-
al class through the NIST library. The results are listed in Table 
1 according to their elution order on a HP-5ms column, as visu-
alized on Figure 1. The sample consisted primarily of methox-
ylated flavones: 5,2?-dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone (4.85%), 
4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5,6-dihy-
droxy-7,8-dimethoxy-(3.21%), and 4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 
2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxy-(0.79%); 
a flavonoid glycoside [4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, 7-(?-D-gluco-
pyranosyloxy)-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-] 
which was the base peak (10.11%); fatty acids: n-hexadecano-
ic acid (3.08 %) and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)- (1.06%); 
sterols: androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (0.94%), stigmasterol (4.51%), 
and ?-sitosterol (3.08%); a diarylethene ether, 3,3?,4,4?-tetrame-
thoxystilbene (4.91%); a polyprenol, 1,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosa-
hexaen-3-ol, 2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-, (all-E)- (1.32%); a 
lignan, yangambin (0.71%); an aryl isocyanate, 3,5-dimethylphe-
nyl isocyanate (0.86%); an alkyl ester, propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 
1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-methyl-1,3-propanediyl ester (0.35%); 
and two constituents with diverse functional groups: benzalde-
hyde, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy-, [(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphe-
nyl)methylene]hydrazine (5.30%) and 2H,8H-benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b?]

Hierarchical clustering has been utilized to interpret GC-
MS data. This was done through calculating the distance matrices 
of data objects and then merging objects that are close to each 
other to form sub-clusters (Moon et al., 2009). Further generation 
of the Figure 2 was facilitated through the clustergram function of 
MATLAB.

2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxy-(14), and 
?-sitosterol (5) formed a distinct cluster with a relatively high-
er RI and low percent peak area. This indicated that there were 
small quantities of relatively non-polar components in APR. An-
other cluster was formed from compounds of diverse function-
ality. Another segregated group constituted 3,5-dimethylphenyl 
isocyanate (1), propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 1-(1,1-dimethyleth-
yl)-2-methyl-1,3-propanediyl ester (2), n-hexadecanoic acid (3), 
and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)- (4). 1,2,3,4, which were 
mostly fatty acids, exhibited the lowest RI and abundance. Lastly, 
it should be noted that SKI (7), whose chemical structure is seen 
in Figure 3, was found to be of relatively high abundance in APR.
sPLA2 activity of N. philippinensis venom
The plot of absorbance values of as a function of time 
is shown in Figure 4 for both NPV and bee venom. By using Eq. 
(1), sPLA2 activity was calculated for bee venom and NPV, which 
were 0.1074 ± 0.0031 ?mol/minutes/ml and 0.0796 ± 0.0018 ?mol/
minutes/ml, respectively. The results suggested that the sPLA2 
activity of bee venom is higher than that of NPV. As expected, 
NPV contains sPLA2, which is typical for venoms extracted from 
related Naja species (Gopi et al., 2014). However, the amount of 
sPLA2 responsible for the hydrolysis of the substrate cannot be 
determined directly using this assay. The presence of other proteins 
in Naja sp. such as neurotoxins, natrin, disintegrin, cholesterinase, 
and hyaluronidase should also be taken into account.
Inhibitory sPLA2 activity of APR and SKI
The sPLA2 activities in the presence of inhibitors were 
determined similarly using Eq. (1) and compared with that of NPV 
in the absence of inhibitors (0.0837 ± 0.0017 ?mol/minutes/ml). 
The roots showed the high activity as exhibited by the IC50 value at 
192.7 ± 10.9 ?g/ml. SKI, isolated from APR, also displayed strong 
inhibitory effect on phospholipase activity with an IC50 value of 
51.1 ± 3.5 ?g/ml (Fig. 5). Due to the low IC50 concentration, it 
can be presumed that SKI induced the perceived bioactivity. 
Flavones have been found to have anti-venom activity such as that 
of the flavonoid extract of the root bark of Parinari curatellifolia 
which was indicated to offer significant protection (p < 0.05) 
against Echis carinatus venom at a dose of 237 mg/kg (Omale 
et al., 2012). Pure compounds such as aristolochic acid from 
herbal sources have been found to increase the immune response 
and decrease lytic and edematose action of some phospholipases 
of snake venoms (Gomes et al., 2010). Coumestan and steroids 
such as ?-sitosterol and stigmasterol (derived from the methanolic 
root extract of Pluchea indica) circumvented lipid peroxidation 
and superoxide dismutase activity induced by venom inoculation 
(Gomes et al., 2007). Catequines, flavones, anthocyanines, and 
condensed tannins were observed to inhibit hemorrhage induced 
by Bothrops asper venom and was correlated to the chelation 
of the zinc in metalloproteinases (Castro et al., 1999). The leaf 
powder of A. paniculata along with other plants is traditionally 
used in Tamil Nadu, India as an oral concoction in envenomings 
(Srivastava and Pandey, 2006). In the Khamti tribe of Arunachal 
Pradesh, India, A. paniculata seed powder is administered orally as

an antidote for snake bites (Das and Hui, 2006). Ethanolic extract 
of A. paniculata has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory
activity and inhibitory/neutralizing effect on sPLA2, however, only 
few attempts have been done to determine the potent compound 
responsible for this activity (Kishore et al., 2016).
In this work, SKI and APR have shown inhibitory 
activities against sPLA2 although there were no previous reports 
of the aforementioned. We earlier reported that both APR is not 
cytotoxic (IC50 > 100 mg/ml) to wild type primary human dermal 
neonatal fibroblasts (HDFn) (Tan et al., 2018). The snake venom 
neutralization by constituents of plants like A. paniculata roots 
could be the first line of defense to the attenuation of the catalytic 
and hydrolytic properties of snake toxins which mitigate tissue 
damage and increase the life expectancy.
Molecular docking of SKI with PLA2
The summary of docking and cluster analysis using 
AutoDock 4.0 is shown in Table 2. The best candidates after the 
screening are the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) homologues. Four 
structures (1LN8, 1S6B, 1PSH, and 1A3F) (Berman et al., 2000) 
were chosen for further docking analysis and the best-docked 
conformation of SKI for each target is shown in Figure 6. These 
are all crystal structures of PLA2 proteins found in the venom of 
Napa sp. 1LN8 and 1S6B are different isoforms of PLA2 from 
Naja sagittifera. While 1LN8 was crystallized as a monomer

with free bound Ca2+, 1S6B was crystallized as a dimer where the 
bound calcium ions (Ca2+) of the monomers are relocated from the 
calcium binding domain to the intermolecular space where they 
are supposed to be responsible for dimerization (Jabeen et al., 
2005) and thus, the Ca2+ ions are not able to interact with a ligand. 
1PSH and 1A3F are the crystal structures of PLA2 from N. naja. 
1PSH was crystallized with the bound Ca2+ intact, while 1A3F was 
crystallized independently under Ca2+-free conditions (Fremont 
et al., 1993; Segelke et al., 1998). As seen in Table 2, highly negative 
binding energies are predicted for the binding of skullcapflavone
to PLA2 proteins. The negative binding energies are due to the 
various non-bonding interactions of SKI with the active site 
residues of the four proteins. For SKI-1LN8, H14 interacted with 
the carbonyl carbon of Leu2 and H7 interacted with the carbonyl 
of Phe22. For SKI-1S6B, O3 interacted with the side chain NH3
+ 
of Lys64 and H14 interacted with the carbonyl of Thr2. For SKI-
1PSH, H14 interacted with the carbonyl of Asp148, O6 interacted 
with the imidazole group of His47, O4 interacted with the amino 
H of Gly31. Finally, for SKI-1A3F, H14 interacted with the 
carbonyl group of Gly29 and O1 interacted with the phenol OH of 
Tyr63. The strong non-bonding interactions between SKI and the 
proteins suggested that it is highly likely for SKI to inhibit PLA2 
proteins. Thus, the observed experimental anti-venom properties 
of the compound could be attributed to the inhibition of PLA2 of

N. philippinensis. It is known that PLA2 are critical compounds for 
snake venoms, as they facilitate the lysis of cell membranes of prey 
cells (Gutiérrez and Lomonte, 1995). Therefore, the inhibition of 
PLA2 proteins can reasonably explain the decreased venomous 
activity of the snake venom in the presence of SKI.
From Table 2, it can be observed that proteins which 
contain a free bound Ca2+ (1LN8 and 1PSH) have a higher binding 
energy compared to proteins with no free bound Ca2+ (1S6B and 
1A3F) available to interact with the ligand. From Figure 6, it is 
shown that when Ca2+ (green spheres in 1LN8 and 1PSH) are 
present in the binding site, it interacts with an electron rich group, 
i.e., oxygen, of the SKI. In addition, to the nonbonding interactions
mentioned, it is possible that the ion-dipole interaction between 
SKI and Ca2 contributed to the higher binding energy in 1LN8 and 
1PSH. This indicated that the presence of bound Ca2+ is important 
in the binding of the compound to PLA2 proteins.
CONCLUSION
In summation, NPV sPLA2 activity was confirme  
with a calculated activity of 0.0796 ± 0.0018 ?mol/minutes/ml 
compared with bee venom sPLA2 activity of 0.1074 ± 0.0031 
?mol/minutes/ml. This was typical for venoms extracted from 
related Naja species (Omale et al., 2012). Antivenom activity was 
proved through the inhibition of sPLA2 activity by APR (IC50: 
192.7 ± 10.9 ?g/ml) and SKI isolated from APR (IC50: 51.1 ± 3.5 
?g/ml). SKI had a lower IC50 suggesting that SKI was the active 
component of APR’s anti-venom effects. Further molecular docking 
analysis showed highly negative binding energies for the binding 
of SKI to PLA2 proteins which suggested the inhibitory potential 
of SKI. An interesting observation was that proteins which contain 
a free bound Ca2+ have a more negative binding energy compared 
with proteins without a free bound Ca2+. It was shown that when 
Ca2+ is present in the binding site, it interacts with electron rich 
groups in SKI. We previously reported that APR is not cytotoxic 
(IC50 > 100 mg/ml) to wild type HDFn (Tan et al., 2018). The 
NPV neutralization by constituents of APR, which was found to 
be rich in phytosterols and methoxylated flavones as deduced from 
GC-EI-MS analyses, was found to be promising and could be a start 
of the deeper understanding of the anti-venom properties of APR.
