ABSTRACT 
Squalene (1), polyprenol (2), triglycerides (3), and ?-sitosterol (4), isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves 
of Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum, were evaluated for their anti-proliferative activities against three human cancer cell lines, 
breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and a normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast neonatal (HDFn) using 
the in vitro PrestoBlue® cell viability assay.   The HT-29 cell line was most susceptible to the compounds tested.  Squalene 
(1) and polyprenol (2) were most cytotoxic against HT-29 (IC50 of 0.84 and 1.059 ?g/mL, respectively), followed by MCF-
7 (IC50 of 4.404 and 3.786 ?g/mL, respectively), and HCT-116 (IC50 of 7.859 and 9.258 ?g/mL, respectively).  
Triglycerides (3) was highly anti-proliferative against HT-29 cells (IC50 of 2.738 ?g/mL) and moderately inhibitory against 
HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells (IC50 of 13.05 and 16.12 ?g/mL, respectively).  ?-Sitosterol (4) was most cytotoxic against HT-
29 and MCF-7 (IC50 of 1.41 and 2.277 ?g/mL, respectively) and moderately cytotoxic against HCT-116 (IC50 of 11.63 
?g/mL).  Comparing the cytotoxic effects of these compounds against the three cancer cell lines, 1-4 were most cytotoxic 
against HT-29. Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were less inhibitory to MCF-7 and least inhibitory to HCT-116.  Comparing the 
effects of 1-4 on the two colon cancer cell lines, their IC50 values against HT-29 were lower than those of HCT-116.  
Compounds 1-4 showed moderate cytotoxicity against HDFn cells (11.18 to 17.72 ?g/mL) and were less cytotoxic to the 
normal cells than the cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION 
Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum (A. Juss.) Miq. of the family 
Meliaceae may be found in thickets and primary and 
secondary lowland forests up to 1,800 m asl in many parts 
of the Philippines where it is locally known as “igyo”, and 
in other Malesian regions down to Samoa1.  Commonly 
known as ivory mahogany, the mature plant may be used 
as a general purpose timber2.  In traditional folk medicine, 
decoction of chopped leaves and bark are used to treat 
coughs, skin irritations, body aches, lung hemorrhage, and 
sexually transmitted diseases and are also used to induce 
vomiting after food poisoning3,4.  In addition, it was 
reported that the juice extracted from the leaves may be 
used as an early abortifacient5.  In another study, the 
plant’s bark yielded four new compounds, dysoxylins 
A?D, belonging to the tetranortriterpenoid family, which 
demonstrated strong bioactivity against anti-respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV)6,7. Structure elucidation of isolates 
from hexane and choloroform extracts of the plant’s stem 
bark yielded p-hydroxyacetophenone, ?-sitosterol, and 
stigmasterol8.  A new limonoid, gaudichaudysolin A, 
isolated from the plant’s bark, was evaluated in vitro for its 
cytotoxic effects against five human cancer cell lines: 
HL60 (human blood premyelocytic leukemia), RPMI8226 
(multiple myeloma), NCI-H226 (non-small cell lung 
carcinoma), HCT116 (human colon cancer), and MCF7 
(human breast adenocarcinoma) cells9. This study was 
conducted as part of our research on the chemical 
constituents of the genus Dysoxylum found in the 
Philippines.  We earlier reported the isolation of new 
glabretal-type triterpenoids along with the known

compounds, 24,25-epoxy-3?,23-dihydroxy-7-tirucallene, 
squalene, polyprenol, linoleic acid and lutein from the 
leaves of Dysoxylum  mollissimum  Blume10. Recently, we 
reported that the crude dicloromethane leaf extract of 
Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum (A. Juss.) Miq. exhibited 
IC50 values of 7.35 and 13.19 µg/mL against breast cancer 
(MCF-7) and colon cancer (HT-29) cells, respectively.  
Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane leaf extract 
led to the isolation of squalene (1), polyprenols (2), 
triglycerides (3), and ?-sitosterol (4)11.  We report herein

(5, 124) = 11.35, p < 0.0001 and (B)  F (10, 124) = 6.025, p < 0.0001.

the cytotoxicity studies on 1-4 (Figure 1) isolated from the 
leaves of D. gaudichaudianum.  To the best of our 
knowledge this is the first report on the IC50 values of 2 
and 3 against breast and colon cancers. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Sample Collection 
Samples of leaves and twigs of Dysoxylum 
gaudichaudianum (A. Juss.) Miq. were collected from the 
De La Salle University – Science and Technology 
Complex (DLSU-STC) riparian forest in February 2014.  
The samples were authenticated and deposited at the De La 
Salle University Herbarium with voucher specimen #920.  
Isolation and Structure Elucidation 
The isolation and structure elucidation of 1-4 from the 
leaves of D.  gaudichaudianum were reported previously11. 
Preparation of Compounds for Cytotoxicity Tests 
The compounds (1-4) from D.  gaudichaudianum were 
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 4 
mg/mL stock solution.   Working solutions were prepared 
in complete growth medium to a final non-toxic DMSO 
concentration of 0.1%. 
Maintenance and Preparation of Cell Lines for 
Cytotoxicity Tests 
The cytotoxicity of 1-4 from the dichloromethane 
(CH2Cl2) extracts from D.  gaudichaudianum was tested 
on the following human cell lines:  breast cancer (MCF-7), 
colon cancer (HCT-116 and HT-29; ATCC, Manassas, 
Virginia, U.S.A.), and human dermal fibroblast, neonatal 
(HDFn; Invitrogen Life Technologies, U.S.A.), which are 
routinely maintained at the Cell and Tissue Culture 
Laboratory, Molecular Science Unit, Center for Natural 
Science and Environmental Research, De La Salle 
University, Manila, Philippines.  Following standard 
procedures12,13, cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified 
Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco®, USA) containing 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco®, USA) and 1x antibiotic-
antimycotic (Gibco®, USA) and kept in an incubator  
(37°C, 5% CO2, 98% humidity).   At 80% confluence, the 
monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS, pH 7.4, Gibco®, USA), trypsinized with 0.05%  
 
Figure 3:  Dose-response curves showing the cytotoxic activities of 1-4 and Zeocin on the cell viability of MCF-7, 
HCT-116, HT-29 and HDFn. Each plot shows the effect of a compound against all cell lines tested.  Data shown are 
means of triplicates.  GraphPad Prism 6.07 was used to perform extra sum-of-squares F test to (A) evaluate if the best-
fit parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) differs among data sets (treatments), and (B) determine the 
differences among the dose-response curve fits.  The results are: compound 1 (A) F (DFn, DFd) = F (3, 88) = 39.06, p 
< 0.0001 and (B) F (6, 88) = 19.64, p < 0.0001; compound 2 (A) F (3, 80) = 30.83, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (6, 80) = 
15.61, p < 0.0001; compound 3 (A) F (3, 88) = 3.711, p = 0.0145 and (B) F (6, 88) = 3.797, p = 0.0021; compound 4 
(A) F (3, 88) = 10.27, p < 0.0001 and (B) F (6, 88) = 5.419, p < 0.0001.

Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco®, USA) and resuspended with fresh 
complete media.  Cells were counted following standard 
trypan blue exclusion method using 0.4% Trypan Blue 
Solution (Gibco®, USA).   Cells were seeded in 100-µL 
aliquots into 96-well microtiter plates (FalconTM, USA) 
using a final inoculation density of 1 x 104 cells/well.  The 
plates were further incubated overnight (37°C, 5% CO2, 
98% humidity) until complete cell attachment was 
reached.  These cells were used for the cytotoxicity studies 
as described below. 
Cell Viability Assay  
The cytotoxicity of the D.  gaudichaudianum compounds 
was determined in a cell viability assay using PrestoBlue® 
(Molecular Probes®, Invitrogen, USA).  This test is based 
on the presence of mitochondrial reductase in viable cells 
which then reduces the resazurin dye (blue and 
nonfluorescent) in the reagent to resorufin (red and highly 
fluorescent).  The conversion is proportional to the number 
of metabolically active cells and is determined 
quantitatively using absorbance measurements.  To the 
monolayers in the microtiter plate, 100 µL of filter-
sterilized 1-4 were added to corresponding wells at two-
fold serial dilutions to make final screening concentrations 
of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 µg/mL.  
The treated cells were further incubated (37°C, 5% CO2, 
98% humidity) for 4 days.  Ten microliters of PrestoBlue® 
was added to each well. The cells were incubated (37°C, 
5% CO2, 98% humidity) for 2 hr.  Wells with no compound 
added served as negative controls while wells with 
ZeocinTM (Gibco®, USA) served as positive controls.  
Wells containing cell culture media only were used to 
correct for background absorbance.  Absorbance 
measurements were carried out using BioTek ELx800 
Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek® Instruments, 
Inc., U.S.A.) at 570 nm and normalized to 600 nm values 
(reference wavelength).  Absorbance readings were used 
to calculate for the cell viability for each sample 
concentration following the equation below.

(?????????? ?? ??????? ????????????????? ?? ?????)
(?????????? ?? ???????? ?????????????????? ?? ?????)

Nonlinear regression and statistical analyses were done 
using GraphPad Prism 6.07 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to 
extrapolate the half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 
(the concentration of the compound which resulted in a 
50% reduction in cell viability).  The cytotoxicity of 1-4 
was expressed as IC50 values.  All tests were performed in 
triplicates and data were shown as means.  The extra sum-
of-squares F test was used to evaluate the differences in the 
best-fit parameter (half maximal inhibitory concentration) 
among data sets (treatments) and to determine the 
differences among dose-response curve fits according to 
the software’s recommended approach. One-way ANOVA 
(p < 0.05) was also used to determine significant 
differences among treatments, followed by Tukey’s 
multiple comparison post hoc test (p < 0.05), to compare 
different pairs of data sets.  Results were considered 
significant at p < 0.05.   
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSION  
This work presents studies on the cytotoxic activities of 
squalene (1), polyprenol (2), triglycerides (3), and ?-
sitosterol (4), previously isolated from the 
dichloromethane extracts of D.  gaudichaudianum 
leaves11, against three human cancer cell lines, breast 
(MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and a human 
normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast, neonatal 
(HDFn).  A known anti-cancer drug, Zeocin, was used as 
positive control. The % cell viability as a function of the 
logarithmic values of compound concentration is shown in 
Figures 2 and 3.  Most plots nearly follow the typical 
sigmoidal curve which is characteristic of an inhibitory 
dose-response relationship between treatments and cell 
viability.  Figure 2 compares the anti-proliferative effects 
per cell line, while Figure 3 compares the effects per 
compound.  The corresponding IC50 values are 
summarized in Table 1. The breast cancer cell line (MCF-
7) is most susceptible to 4, 2, and 1 with IC50 values of 
2.277, 3.786, and 4.404 ?g/mL, respectively, and least 
susceptible to 3 with an IC50 value of 16.12 ?g/mL.  One-
way ANOVA showed that all treatments are statistically 
different (p < 0.0001), but Tukey’s multiple comparison 
post hoc test revealed that there are no pairwise differences 
between 1 and 2, 1 and Zeocin, 2 and 4, and 2 and Zeocin 
(p > 0.05).  The colon cancer cell line (HCT-116) is most 
susceptible to 1 and 2 with IC50 values of 7.859 and 9.258 
?g/mL, respectively, followed by 4 and 3 with IC50 values 
of 11.63, and 13.05 ?g/mL, respectively.  One-way 
ANOVA showed that all treatments are statistically 
different (p < 0.0001), but Tukey’s multiple comparison 
post hoc test showed pairwise differences only between 1 
and 4 (p < 0.0001), and 2 and 3 (p < 0.01).  The growth of

(treatments).  The results are:  MCF-7, F (5, 118) = 35.74, p < 0.0001; HCT-116, F (5, 110) = 182.4, p < 0.0001; HT-
29, F (5, 118) = 107.1, p < 0.0001; HDFn, F (5, 118) = 275.3, p < 0.0001.    Results of the Tukey’s multiple comparison 
post hoc test are discussed in this section.

the other colon cancer cell line (HT-29) exhibited the 
strongest inhibition at the lowest concentrations of the 
compounds, with IC50 values of 0.84, 1.059, 1.41, 2.738 
?g/mL for 1, 2, 4 and 3, respectively.   Tukey’s multiple 
comparison post hoc test showed statistical differences 
between all treatments except for 4 and Zeocin (p > 0.05).  
The normal cell line, HDFn, responded moderately to all 
the compounds, with IC50 values of 11.18, 12.4, 17.01, and 
17.72 ?g/mL for 4, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  The pairs of 
compounds, 1 and 4, and 2 and 3 are not statistically 
different (p > 0.05).   Data analysis showed statistical 
differences in the best-fit parameter (half maximal 
inhibitory concentration) among treatments and among the 
dose-response curve fits (Figures 2 and 3).  Overall, 
comparing the three human cancer cell lines, HT-29 
showed the most cytotoxic response to the compounds 
tested (IC50 value of 0.84 ?g/mL for squalene (1)).  This 
was followed by MCF-7 cells (IC50 values of 2.77 and 
3.786 ?g/mL for ?-sitosterol (4) and polyprenol (2), 
respectively).   In a preliminary study on the cytotoxic 
activity of the dichloromethane extract of D.  
gaudichaudianum leaves, the crude extract exhibited 
cytotoxic activities with IC50 values of 13.19 and 7.35 
?g/mL for HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cells, respectively11.  
In the current study, the isolated compounds from the 
extract exhibited high anti-proliferative activities against 
the cell lines used, indicating that these compounds may 
be responsible for the cytotoxicity of the extract.   Among 
the cancer cell lines tested, HCT-116 showed the least 
response to the compounds.  On the other hand, the normal 
cell line, HDFn, exhibited moderate susceptibility only.  
The most cytotoxic effect was seen in HT-29 cells using 
squalene (1), while the least anti-proliferative effect was 
observed in MCF-7 cells treated with triglycerides (3).   
Overall, 1-4 showed varying, but promising cytotoxic 
properties. The US National Cancer Institute has defined 
the active cytotoxic limits of natural products as 20 ?g/mL 
or less for crude extracts and 4 ?g/mL or less for pure 
compounds14.  Pure compounds that exhibit active 
cytotoxicity may have some potential for drug 
development13.  The results showed that 1-4 from the 
dichloromethane extracts of D.  gaudichaudianum leaves 
can be further developed for the treatment of human 
colorectal type and human breast cancers. The study also 
showed that the cytotoxic activity of 1-4 was a function of 
the specific type of cancer cells targeted.  When the two 
colon cancer cell lines are compared, the IC50 values of 1-
4 for HT-29 were lower than HCT-116, implying that the 
former could be more responsive to anti-cancer treatments 
using the compounds tested.  It was reported that variances 
in the expression profiles of several genes associated with 
drug sensitivity between HCT-116 and HT-29 could 
influence the cells’ response to different inhibitory 
compounds15.   A related study using four human colon 
cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29, HCT-15, and KM-12) 
revealed that gene expression profiling after inhibition of 
signal transduction by 17-allylamino-17-
demethoxygeldanamycin, a known inhibitor of the hsp90 
molecular chaperone, could explain how cells respond 
under different treatment conditions16. Previous studies 
revealed that squalene, polyprenols, triglycerides, and ?-
sitosterol exhibited cytotoxic and anticancer properties. 
Squalene (1) was reported to exhibit antitumor activities 
against colon cancer in rodents17.   It was also found to 
remarkably control colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) 
formation and crypt multiplicity in laboratory rats which 
supported the hypothesis that it possesses 
chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis18.   
In a study evaluating the anti-proliferative effects of 
tocotrienols, carotenoids, squalene, and coenzyme Q10 
from palm oil against two human breast cancer cell lines, 
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, it was found that there was a 
suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer 
of activated B-cells (NF-?B) protein in the breast cancer 
cells exposed briefly to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
?)19,20.  The protective and therapeutic effects of squalene-
containing compounds on the promotion of tumor cells 
have been reported21.  Relevant reviews on the bioactive 
properties of squalene have been provided22,23.  Thus, 1 
was reported to exhibit cytotoxic properties against colon 
and breast cancer cells which corroborate our findings that 
1 showed high cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells, HT-
29 and HCT-116, and breast cancer cells, MCF-7, with 
IC50 values of 0.84, 7.859 and 4.404 ?g/mL, respectively. 
Polyprenols (2) from Ginkgo biloba L. showed 
hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-stimulated 
hepatotoxicity in rats24 and exhibited antitumor 
activity25.   Polyprenols inhibited Heps, S (180) and EC 
transplanted tumors by at least 50%25.  Polyprenol, with 
concentrations between 10?3-10?4 M, induced apoptosis in 
multidrug-resistant MCF-7 cells by reducing the resistance 
marker, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in the plasma membrane26.  
In a related study, MCF-7 cells treated with 10?4 M of 
polyprenol resulted in the downregulation of DPAGT1 
overexpression which led to the regulation of E-cadherin 
expression, an important factor in the prevention of tumors 
and metastasis27. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first report on the cytotoxicity of 2 against colon cancer 
cells HT-29 and HCT116 and breast cancer cells MCF-7, 
with IC50 values of 1.059, 9.258 and 3.786 ?g/mL, 
respectively. Triacylglycerols (3) from Tuna (1000 mg/kg) 
was reported to significantly inhibit the tumor growth in 
the spleen of mice with intrasplenically-implanted Lewis 
lung carcinoma28.  Triacylglycerols, which account for 12-
20% of the total seed weight of pomegranate (Punica 
granatum) seed oil (PSO) extract, was found to 
significantly decrease cell viability in two breast cancer 
cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-729.  To our 
knowledge, this is the first report on the cytotoxicity of 3 
against colon cancer cells, HT-29 and HCT116, and breast 
cancer cells, MCF-7, with IC50 values of 2.738, 13.05, and 
16.12 ?g/mL, respectively. ?-Sitosterol (4) was found to 
affect the programmed cell death pathway in human breast 
cancer cells (MCF-7) and human adenocarcinoma cells 
(MDA-MB-231), hindering tumor growth by promoting 
apoptosis30.  It also inhibited cell proliferation of human 
colon cancer cells (HT-29)31.   ?-Sitosterol (4) inhibited the 
growth of HT116 human colon cancer cells by different 
mechanisms including the activation of caspase-3 and 
caspase-9, accompanied by proteolytic cleavage of 
Mariquit et al. /Cytotoxic Compounds from…

poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase and the reduction of the 
expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and mRNA 
and a subsequent increase of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein 
and mRNA32.   In vitro studies showed that 4 inhibited the 
proliferation of human colon cancer cells (COLO 320 DM) 
with an IC50 of 266.2 ?M, inducing apoptosis by 
scavenging oxidants and attenuating ?-catenin and PCNA 
expression while in vivo studies showed that 4 reduced the 
number of aberrant crypt and crypt multiplicity in DMH-
initiated rats in a dose-dependent fashion33.  ?-Sitosterol 
(4) significantly decreased the expression of Niemann-
Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) in human small intestine 
epithelial cells (FHs 74 Int), reducing intestinal cholesterol 
absorption at the cellular level34.  It also promoted 
apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the 
downregulation of Akt in murine fibrosarcoma cells 
(MCA-102)35.  It was reported that 4 and stigmasterol 
exhibited anti-proliferative activities against human 
prostate cancer cells (DU-145) by increasing the 
expression of p53 protein and inhibiting carcinoma 
development by decreasing the expression of p21 and p27 
proteins36.  Thus, 4 was reported to exhibit cytotoxic 
properties against several cancer cell lines such as colon 
and breast cancer cell lines which corroborate our findings 
that 4 showed high cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells, 
HT-29, and breast cancer cells, MCF-7, with IC50 values 
of 1.41 and 2.277 ?g/mL, respectively.   
 
CONCLUSION 
Squalene (1), polyprenols (2), triglycerides (3), and ?-
sitosterol (4), isolated from the dichloromethane extract of 
Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum leaves, exhibited varying 
cytotoxic activities against three human cancer cell lines, 
breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116), and a 
normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast, neonatal 
(HDFn).  The anti-proliferative activities of 1-4 were 
highest against HT-29, with IC50 values ranging from 0.84 
to 2.738 ?g/mL, followed by MCF-7, with IC50 values 
ranging from 2.277 to 16.12 ?g/mL, and HCT-116, with 
IC50 values ranging from 7.859 to 13.05 ?g/mL.  All 
compounds (1-4) were moderately cytotoxic against HDFn 
with IC50 values >10 ?g/mL.  Overall, 1-4 were more 
cytotoxic to the breast and colon cancer cell lines than to 
the normal cell line.
