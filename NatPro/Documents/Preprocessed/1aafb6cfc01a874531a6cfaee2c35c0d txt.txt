INTRODUCTION
Macromitrium Brid. is a large genus of pantropical mosses
consisting of xerophytic epiphytes. One member of this genus,
M. orthostichum Nees ex Schwägr. is restricted in Southeast
Asia up to Papua New Guinea was recorded in Luzon, Mindoro
and Mindanao islands in the Philippines [1]. Like other
members of Macromitrium, this species is distinguished from
other mosses by having creeping prostrate stems that give
rise to rigid branches that terminate into sporophytes [2]. The
plant of Macromitrium orthostichum, as in most members of
Macromitrium, have some shades of reddish brown with leaves
variously twisted and contorted around the branches. Macro-
mitrium orthostichum differs from other Macromitrium species
by having papillose rhizoids arising along the basal leaf margins
[3].
There is no report on the chemical constituents and biolo-
gical activities of Macromitrium orthostichum. Herein, the
isolation of zeorin (1), atranorin (2) and a mixture of ?-sitosterol
(3) and stigmasterol (4) (Fig. 1) from the dichloromethane extract
of Macromitrium orthostichum is reported. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of compounds
1-4 from Macromitrium orthostichum.

Chemical investigation of dichloromethane extract of moss Macromitrium orthostichum Nees ex Schwägr. has led to the isolation of
zeorin (1), atranorin (2) and a mixture of ?-sitosterol (3) and stigmasterol (4) in about 1:1 ratio. The structure of compound 1 was
elucidated by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, while compounds 2-4 were identified by comparison of their NMR data with
literature data.

EXPERIMENTAL
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectro-
meter in CDCl3 at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C
NMR spectra. Column chromatography was performed with
silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer chromatography was
performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254
and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4
solution followed by warming.
Sample collection: The Philippine specimen chosen for
present investigation was gathered from a tree branch on a mossy
forest at Mount Natib's Peak, Morong, Bataan, Philippines on
19th December 2017. The specimen was collected and authenti-
cated as Macromitrium orthostichum Nees ex Schwägr. by one
of the authors (VCL).
General isolation procedure: A glass column 12 inches
in height with 0.5 inches in internal diameter was used for the
fractionation of the crude extract. Fractions of 10 mL volumes
were collected and monitored by thin layer chromatography.
Fractions containing spots with similar Rf values were combined
and rechromatographed using the appropriate solvent. Final
purification was carried out using Pasteur pipette as the column,
collecting 1 mL fractions. TLC-pure isolates were combined,
and after evaporation of the solvent were subjected to NMR
analysis.
Isolation of chemical constituents of Macromitrium
orthostichum: The freeze-dried Macromitrium orthostichum
(17.81 g) was ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for three
days and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under
vacuum to afford a crude extract (0.1723 g) which was chromato-
graphed by gradient elution using increasing proportions of
acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10 % increment. The fraction eluted with
40 % acetone in CH2Cl2 was rechromatographed using 10 %
EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of compounds 3
and 4 (2 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. The 50 %
acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using 15 %
EtOAc in petroleum ether, followed by CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2
(0.5:0.5:9, v/v). The fractions eluted with 15 % ethyl acetate
in petroleum ether were combined and rechromatographed using
the same solvent to afford compound 1 (0.7 mg) after washing
with petroleum ether. The fractions eluted with CH3CN:Et2O:
CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9, v/v) was rechromatographed using the same
solvent to yield compound 2 (0.3 mg) after washing with
petroleum ether.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract
of Macromitrium orthostichum afforded zeorin (1), atranorin
(2) and a mixture of ?-sitosterol (3) and stigmasterol (4) in
about 1:1 ratio. The structure of compound 1 was elucidated
by extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and confirmed
by comparison of its NMR data with those reported in the
literature [4]. The NMR data of compound 2 were in accordance
with those reported in the literature for atranorin [4]; compound
3 for ?-sitosterol [5] and compound 4 for strigmasterol [5].
The 1:1 ratio of compounds 3 and 4 was deduced from the
intensities and integrations of the 1H NMR resonances for
olefinic protons at ? 5.35 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, H-5) and methyl
protons at ? 0.66 (s) for compound 3 and olefinic protons at ?
5.35 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, H-5), 5.13 (dd, J = 8.4, 15.6 Hz) and 5.00
(dd, J = 8.4, 15.0 Hz) and the methyl protons at ? 0.68 (s) for
compound 4 [5].
Although there is no reported biological activity for M.
orthostichum, the compounds isolated from the plant were
reported to possess diverse activities. Zeorin (1) and atranorin
(2) exhibited antidiabetic and antioxidant activities [6]. Compound
1 exhibited strong antibacterial and antifungal activities [7].
On the other hand, compound 2 showed antiproliferative action
against malignant cell lines [8], possessed antinociceptive

effects [9,10], exhibited antibiotic action against M. aurum
[11], inhibited leukotriene B4 synthesis in leukocytes [12],
and modulated the wound healing process [13]. ?-Sitosterol
(3) inhibited the growth of human breast MCF-7 and MDA-
MB231 adenocarcinoma cells [14]; was effective for the treat-
ment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [15]; showed potential
as an anticancer drug for colon carcinogenesis [16]; reduced
intestinal cholesterol uptake [17]; and induced apoptosis
mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of
Akt in MCA-102 murine fibrosarcoma cells [18]. On the other
hand, stigmasterol (4) showed therapeutic efficacy against
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in mice [19]; lowered plasma chole-
sterol levels, inhibited cholesterol absorption, and suppressed
hepatic cholesterol and classic bile acid synthesis in rats [20];
showed cytostatic activity against Hep2 and McCoy cells [21];
markedly inhibited tumour promotion [22]; exhibited antimuta-
genic [23], topical anti-inflammatory [24], antiosteoarthritic
[25] and antioxidant [26] activities.
