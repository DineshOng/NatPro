Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Artocarpus ovatus Blanco led to the isolation of 3beta-friedelinol (1), squalene (2), polyprenol (3), triacylglycerols (4), and chlorophyll a (5). The structures of 1-5 were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature. Keywords: Artocarpus ovatus, Moracceae, 3beta-friedelinol, squalene, polyprenol, triacylglycerols, chlorophyll a . . Artocarpus ovatus Blanco, an endemic Philippine tree, produces strong and durable timber which is used for construction [1-2]. A latex obtained from the tree has potential for use as a chewing gum base , while the roasted seeds are eaten . There is no reported study on the chemical constituents of A. ovatus. However, congeners of the tree have been studied for their chemical constituents and biological activities. There are about 50 species of the genus Artocarpus (Moraceae) which are sources of edible fruit and timber and are used in folk medicines. A review of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological activities of Artocarpus has been provided . Compounds from Artocarpus species exhibit diverse biological activities including antibacterial, antitubercular, antiviral, antifungal, antiplatelet, antiarthritic, tyrosinase inhibitory and cytotoxicity . Artocarpus species are used for treatment against inflammation, malarial fever, diarrhoea, diabetes and tapeworm infection. They are rich in phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, stilbenoids, arylbenzofurons and jacalin . This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of the genus Artocarpus found in the Philippines. We earlier reported the isolation of friedelinol, squalene, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol and phytol from the leaves of A. camansi, while the stems yielded polyprenol, cycloartenol and cycloartenol acetate . In another study, the leaves of A. altilis yielded beta-sitosterol, triglycerides, squalene, polyprenol, lutein and fatty acids, while A. odoratissimus afforded beta-sitosterol, triglycerides and fatty acids from the flesh of the fruit and seeds; and beta-sitosterol, fatty acids and hydrocarbons from the fruit rind . Furthermore, the unripe fruit of A. heterophyllus afforded cycloartenone, cycloartenol, and a diastereomeric mixture of 2,3-butanediols . Recently, we reported the isolation of lupeol, alphaamyrin, beta-amyrin, lupeol fatty acid ester, alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester, beta-myrin fatty acid ester, betulin, 3beta,28dihydroxyolean-12-ene, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol, and chlorophyll a from the twigs of A. ovatus .

Ragasa et al Der Pharma Chemica, 2015, 7 (2):178-182 . 179 www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com We report herein the isolation and identification of 3beta-friedelinol (1), squalene (2), polyprenol (3), triacylglycerols (4), and chlorophyll a (5) (Fig. ) from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of A. ovatus. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the isolation of the 1-4 from the tree.

Chemical constituents of Artocarpus ovatus leaves: 3beta-friedelinol (1), squalene (2), polyprenol (3), triacylglycerols (4), and chlorophyll a (5) MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming. Sample Collection The sample was collected from Bataan, Philippines in October 2013. It was identified as Artocarpus ovatus Blanco at the Jose Vera Santos Herbarium, Institute of Biology, University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City. Consolacion Y. Ragasa et al Der Pharma Chemica, 2015, 7 (2):178-182 . 180 www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com General Isolation Procedure A glass column 18 inches in height and 1.0 inche internal diameter was packed with silica gel. The crude extract from the leaves were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10% increment) as eluents. Fifty milliliter fractions were collected. Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained. A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography. Two milliliter fractions were collected. Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. One milliliter fractions were collected. Isolation The air-dried leaves of A. ovatus (336.9 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (7.6 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment. The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ) in 1% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 2 (25 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (5 ) in 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 3 (8 mg) and 4 (5 mg). The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ) in 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to yield 1 (6 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. The 40% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (4 ) in 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 5 (12 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by Et2O. 3beta-Friedelinol (1): Colorless solid.

Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the air-dried leaves of Artocarpus ovatus led to the isolation of 3beta-friedelinol (1) [8, 9], squalene (2) [10, 11], polyprenol (3) [11, 12], triglycerides (4) , and chlorophyll a (5) [7, 11]. The structures of 1-5 were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with literature data [8-12]. Although bioassays were not conducted on the isolated compounds, there were previous studies that reported on their biological activities. beta-Friedelinol (1) showed only antibacterial activity (MIC = 12.5-100 mg/ml) and no antifungal activity . Squalene (2) was reported to significantly suppress colonic ACF formation and crypt multiplicity which strengthened the hypothesis that it possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis . It showed cardioprotective effect which is related to inhibition of lipid accumulation by its hypolipidemic properties and/or its antioxidant properties . A recent study reported that tocotrienols, carotenoids, squalene and coenzyme Q10 have anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells . The preventive and therapeutic potential of squalene containing compounds on tumor promotion and regression have been reported . A recent review on the bioactivities of squalene has been provided . Polyprenols (3) act as co-enzymes of membrane active transport systems for polysaccharides, peptidoglycans and carbohydrate containing biopolymers . Polyprenol from Ginkgo biloba L exhibited hepatoprotective effects against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats . Polyprenols from Ginkgo biloba L. exhibited antitumor activity . The antidyslipidemic activity of polyprenol from Coccinia grandis in high-fat diet-fed hamster model was also reported . Triacylglycerols (4) exhibited antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans, and T. mentagrophytes . Another study reported that triglycerides showed a direct relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation . Chlorophyll a (6) and its various derivatives are used in traditional medicine and for therapeutic purposes . Natural chlorophyll and its derivatives have been studied for wound healing , anti-inflammatory properties , control of calcium oxalate crystals , utilization as effective agents in photodynamic cancer therapy [29-31], and chemopreventive effects in humans [32-33]. A review on digestion, absorption and cancer preventive activity of dietary chlorophyll has been provided .
