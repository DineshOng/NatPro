ABSTRACT 
 
Chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of Artocarpus ovatus Blanco led to the isolation 
of  3?-friedelinol (1), squalene (2), polyprenol (3), triacylglycerols (4), and chlorophyll a (5).  The structures of 1-5 
were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with those reported in the literature. 
 
Keywords: Artocarpus ovatus,  Moracceae, 3?-friedelinol, squalene, polyprenol, triacylglycerols, chlorophyll a

INTRODUCTION 
 
Artocarpus ovatus Blanco, an endemic Philippine tree, produces strong and durable timber which is used for 
construction [1-2]. A latex obtained from the tree has potential for use as a chewing gum base [1], while the roasted 
seeds are eaten [2]. There is no reported study on the chemical constituents of A. ovatus. However, congeners of the 
tree have been studied for their chemical constituents and biological activities. There are about 50 species of the 
genus Artocarpus (Moraceae) which are sources of edible fruit and timber and are used in folk medicines. A review 
of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological activities of Artocarpus has been provided [3]. 
Compounds from Artocarpus species exhibit diverse biological activities including antibacterial, antitubercular, 
antiviral, antifungal, antiplatelet, antiarthritic, tyrosinase inhibitory and cytotoxicity [3]. Artocarpus species are used 
for treatment against inflammation, malarial fever, diarrhoea, diabetes and tapeworm infection. They are rich in 
phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, stilbenoids, arylbenzofurons and jacalin [3].  
 
This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of the genus Artocarpus found in the Philippines. We 
earlier reported the isolation of friedelinol, squalene, ?-sitosterol, stigmasterol and phytol from the leaves of A. 
camansi, while the stems yielded polyprenol, cycloartenol and cycloartenol acetate [4]. In another study, the leaves 
of A. altilis yielded ?-sitosterol, triglycerides, squalene, polyprenol, lutein and fatty acids, while A. odoratissimus 
afforded ?-sitosterol, triglycerides and fatty acids from the flesh of the fruit and seeds; and ?-sitosterol, fatty acids 
and hydrocarbons from the fruit rind [5]. Furthermore, the unripe fruit of A. heterophyllus afforded cycloartenone, 
cycloartenol, and a diastereomeric mixture of 2,3-butanediols [6].  Recently, we reported the isolation of lupeol, ?-
amyrin, ?-amyrin, lupeol fatty acid ester, ?-amyrin fatty acid ester, ?-myrin fatty acid ester, betulin, 3?,28-
dihydroxyolean-12-ene, oleanolic acid, ?-sitosterol, and chlorophyll a from the twigs of A. ovatus [7].

We report herein the isolation and identification of 3?-friedelinol (1), squalene (2), polyprenol (3), triacylglycerols 
(4), and chlorophyll a (5) (Fig.1) from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of A. ovatus.  To the best of our 
knowledge this is the first report on the isolation of the 1-4 from the tree.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
General Experimental Procedure 
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl3 at 600 MHz for 
1H NMR and 150 MHz 
for 13C NMR spectra. Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer 
chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized 
by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.  
 
Sample Collection 
The sample was collected from Bataan, Philippines in October 2013. It was identified as Artocarpus ovatus Blanco 
at the Jose Vera Santos Herbarium, Institute of Biology, University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City.

General Isolation Procedure 
A glass column 18 inches in height and 1.0 inche internal diameter was packed with silica gel. The crude extract 
from the leaves were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in 
dichloromethane (10% increment) as eluents. Fifty milliliter fractions were collected. Fractions with spots of the 
same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were 
obtained. A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography.  
Two milliliter fractions were collected. Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. One 
milliliter fractions were collected. 
 
Isolation 
The air-dried leaves of A. ovatus (336.9 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then filtered. 
The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (7.6 g) which was chromatographed using 
increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment. The 10% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was 
rechromatographed (3 ×) in 1% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 2 (25 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. 
The 20% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (5 ×) in 10% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 3 (8 
mg) and 4 (5 mg). The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ×) in 10% EtOAc in petroleum 
ether to yield 1 (6 mg) after washing with petroleum ether. The 40% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was 
rechromatographed (4 ×) in 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 5 (12 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, 
followed by Et2O.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the air-dried leaves of Artocarpus ovatus led to the 
isolation of 3?-friedelinol (1) [8, 9], squalene (2) [10, 11], polyprenol (3) [11, 12], triglycerides (4) [7], and 
chlorophyll a (5) [7, 11].  The structures of 1-5  were identified by comparison of their 1H and/or 13C NMR data with 
literature data [8-12]. 
 
Although bioassays were not conducted on the isolated compounds, there were previous studies that reported on 
their biological activities. 
 
3?-Friedelinol (1) showed only antibacterial activity (MIC = 12.5-100 mg/ml) and no antifungal activity [13]. 
 
Squalene (2) was reported to significantly suppress colonic ACF formation and crypt multiplicity which 
strengthened the hypothesis that it possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis [14]. It showed 
cardioprotective effect which is related to inhibition of lipid accumulation by its hypolipidemic properties and/or its 
antioxidant properties [15]. A recent study reported that tocotrienols, carotenoids, squalene and coenzyme Q10 have 
anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells [16]. The preventive and therapeutic potential of squalene containing 
compounds on tumor promotion and regression have been reported [17]. A recent review on the bioactivities of 
squalene has been provided [18]. 
 
Polyprenols (3) act as co-enzymes of membrane active transport systems for polysaccharides, peptidoglycans and 
carbohydrate containing biopolymers [19]. Polyprenol from Ginkgo biloba L exhibited hepatoprotective effects 
against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats [20]. Polyprenols from Ginkgo biloba L. exhibited antitumor activity 
[21]. The antidyslipidemic activity of polyprenol from Coccinia grandis in high-fat diet-fed hamster model was also 
reported [22]. 
 
Triacylglycerols (4) exhibited antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans, and T. 
mentagrophytes [23]. Another study reported that triglycerides showed a direct relationship between toxicity and 
increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation [24].   
 
Chlorophyll a (6) and its various derivatives are used in traditional medicine and for therapeutic purposes [25].  
Natural chlorophyll and its derivatives have been studied for wound healing [26], anti-inflammatory properties [27], 
control of calcium oxalate crystals [28], utilization as effective agents in photodynamic cancer therapy [29-31], and 
chemopreventive effects in humans [32-33]. A review on digestion, absorption and cancer preventive activity of 
dietary chlorophyll has been provided [34].
