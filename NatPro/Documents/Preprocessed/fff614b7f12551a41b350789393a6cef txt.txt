INTRODUCTION 
 
Eucalyptus deglupta (Blume) of the family Myrtaceae, commonly known as Mindanao gum or rainbow 
eucalyptus, is native to the Philippines and other western Pacific islands, adapting well in lowland humid 
tropical conditions and reaching up to 100 ft. in height [1].   It is cultivated throughout the world as an 
ornamental tree, noted for its spectrum of colors developed by the peeling of its smooth bark in a fatigue-
inspired pattern, revealing multi-colored streaks of yellow, red, blue, orange, green, purple, brown, and gray 
shades [1, 2]. The genus Eucalyptus has been a traditional source of timber, cellulose-related products and 
essential oils from the leaves [3, 4].   
 
An antihypertensive food and food additive containing an extract prepared from eucalyptus plants 
was reported [5].  Essential oils from the leaves of E. deglupta and other related aromatic plants were reported 
to inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [6].  E. deglupta was reported to exhibit a high percentage of 
xanthine oxidase inhibition (IC50 of 44.5 ?g/mL) and also prevented cataract development in streptozotocin 
diabetic rats [7].  A review on the chemical constituents and biological activities of the genus Eucalyptus has 
been provided [5].  More than two hundred nonvolatile compounds from this genus have been characterized 
for their chemical structures and biological activities [5].  Phloroglucinol derivatives from Eucalyptus have 
growth regulatory, antigranulation, antiinflammatory and antimalarial activities, while rutin and other 
flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins from Eucalyptus are of great pharmaceutical importance [5]. 
 
The essential oils from the dried leaves of five species of the genus Eucalyptus (E. camaldulensis, E. 
deglupta, E. grandis, E. torelliana, E. urophylla) were found to contain as major components the following 
terpenes:  ?-pinene, ?-pinene, ?-phellandrene, limonene, ?-terpinene, p-cymene and ?-caryophyllene 
[9].  Another study reported that the steam-volatile portion of E. deglupta yielded 40%  terpene fraction which 
contained (±)-?-pinene, (-)-?-phellandrene, p-cymene, ocimene, isovaleraldehyde, (-)-carvotanacetone, and (+)
-nerolidol [10]. Moreover, the leaf essential oil of E. deglupta is mainly composed of sesquiterpenoids (48%), of 
which E-nerolidol was the major component (34.8%) [11].    
 
Another study reported the isolation of tritriacontane-16,18-dione, 8-methoxyellagic acid-2-
rhamnoside, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins from the extracts of the wood and bark of E. deglupta.   The extracts 
also afforded a low molecular weight Si containing compound which is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 virus 
[12].  The Si containing substance is manufactured by hot water extraction of E. deglupta followed by gel 
filtration [13].  The isolation of ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, and squalene from the leaves and twigs and 
nerolidol from the leaves of E. deglupta have been reported [14].   
 
We report herein the isolation and structure elucidation of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-
dimethylflavone (1) from the twigs of E. deglupta.  To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the 
isolation of 1 from E. deglupta.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
General Experimental Procedure 
 
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl3 at 600 MHz for 
1
H NMR and 
150 MHz for 
13
C NMR spectra.  Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).  Thin 
layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were 
visualized by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Sample Collection 
 
Samples of leaves and twigs of Eucalyptus deglupta (Blume) were a generous gift collected from the 
Center for Ecozoic Living and Learning (CELL), Silang, Cavite in May 2014.  The samples were authenticated at 
the Botany Division of the National Museum, Manila, Philippines and deposited with voucher # 268-2014.  
 
General Isolation Procedure 
 
A glass column 20 inches in height and 2.0 inches internal diameter was packed with silica gel. The 
crude extract from the leaves were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of 
acetone in dichloromethane (10% increment) as eluents. One hundred milliliter fractions were collected.  All 
fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography. Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were 
combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained. A 
glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography. Five 
milliliter fractions were collected. Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. One 
milliliter fractions were collected. 
 
Isolation 
 
The air-dried twigs of E. deglupta (173 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and 
then filtered.  The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to afford a crude extract (18 g) which was 
chromatographed using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% increment.   The 30% acetone in 
CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (3 ×) in 20% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 1 (7 mg) after washing 
with petroleum ether, followed by Et2O.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the twigs of Eucalyptus deglupta (Blume) 
led to the isolation of 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone (1). The structure of 1 was elucidated by 
extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as follows. 
 
The 
1
H NMR spectrum of 1 indicated resonances for two aromatic methyl singlets at ? 2.20 and 2.38; 
methoxy groups at ? 3.78 and 3.88; a deshielded olefinic proton singlet at ? 6.61;  aromatic proton doublets at 
? 7.02 (2H) and 7.86 (2H) othro coupled to each other by 9 Hz which was confirmed by COSY; and  a chelated 
OH at ? 12.89.   
 
The 
13
C NMR spectrum of 1 gave resonances for a conjugated carbonyl carbon at ? 183.27; 
oxygenated aromatic carbons at ? 163.88, 162.58 (2C), 157.29 and 153.00; protonated aromatic carbons at ? 
128.00 (2C), 114.56 (2C) and 104.09; four non-protonated aromatic carbons at ? 123,9, 114.10, 108.78 and 
107.40; methoxy carbons at ? 60.51 and 55.53; and methyl carbons at ? 8.57 and 8.27.  These resonances 
indicated a flavone with a hydroxyl, two methoxy and two methyl subtituents.  
 
The protons attached to carbon atoms were assigned from HSQC 2D NMR data (see experimental), 
and the structure of 1 was elucidated by analysis of the HMBC 2D NMR data. Key HMBC correlations are 
shown in Fig. 1. The ortho coupled protons could only be in ring C of the flavone skeleton at C-2', C-3', C-5' and 
C-6', while the chelated hydroxyl could only be attached to C-5.  One of the methoxy groups was attached to C-
4' on the basis of long-range correlations between this methoxy, the ortho aromatic protons and C-4'.  The 
position of the hydroxyl proton was confirmed by correlations with C-5, C-6 and C-10.  One of the methyl  
groups was attached to C-6 due to long-range correlations between this methyl and C-6, C-5 and C-7.  The 
second methoxy group was attached to C-7 based on long-range correlations between this methoxy and C-7.  
The second methyl group was attached to C-8 since long-range correlations were observed between this

methyl and C-8, C-7 and C-9.  The carbonyl was assigned to C-4 on the basis of long-range correlations 
between the H-3 olefinic proton singlet and this carbon.  All long-range correlations observed were consistent 
with the structure of 1.  The structure of 1 was confirmed by positive ESI-MS which gave an [M+H]

 = 327.18 
corresponding to the molecular formula of C19H19O5.

The positions of the methyl and methoxy groups were confirmed by NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2).  One of 
the methoxy groups was close in space to two methyl groups in ring A.  The olefinic proton singlet in ring C was 
close to the more deshielded aromatic proton doublet in ring B, which was in turn close to the relatively more 
shielded aromatic proton doublet, which was finally close to the second methoxy group.  These confirm the 
positions of the methyl and methoxy groups in 1.

Literature search revealed that 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone (1) has been previously 
isolated from the leaves of Callistemon lanceolatus [15].  The structure of this compound was determined by 
MS and 
13
C NMR spectroscopy.  However, the 
13
C NMR
 
resonances in the literature do not match with our 
13
C
 
NMR data and assignments which were based on extensive 1D (
1
H and 
13
C) and 2D (COSY, HSQC, HMBC and 
NOESY) NMR spectroscopy.
