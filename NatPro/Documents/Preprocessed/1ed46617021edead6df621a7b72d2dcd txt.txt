INTRODUCTION 
Pleurotus eryngii, commonly known as king oyster 
mushroom is sold in supermarkets throughout the 
Philippines. A number of studies have been conducted on 
the chemical constituents and biological activities of P. 
eryngii.  The ethanol extract of P. eryngii afforded 
ergosterol peroxide which is an inhibitor of osteoclast 
differentiation. This sterol exhibited an inhibitory effect in 
a dose-dependent manner with an inhibition rate of up to 
62% with low cytotoxicity1. Activity-guided fractionations 
led to the isolation of antitumor compound, ergosterol 
peroxide from the fruiting body of P. eryngii. The IC50 of 
ergosterol peroxide against human lung cancer cell line 
(A549) and human ovarian cell line (SK-OV3) were 7 μM 
and 14 μM, respectively. This sterol showed chromosomal 
DNA fragmentation and arrests G1 phase of the cell 
division cycle2. Another study reported the isolation of 
5α,9α-epidioxy-8α,14α-epoxy-(22E)-ergosta-6,22-dien-
3β-ol, 3β,5α-dihydroxyergost-7-en-6-one, 6β-acetoxy-
(22E)-ergosta-7,22-diene-3β,5α-diol, 3β,5α-dihydroxy-
(22E)-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-one, ergosterol peroxide, 
2α,5α,9α–epidioxy-(22E)-ergosta-7,22-diene-3β,6β-diol, 
5α,9α-epidioxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-
one and 3β,5α,9α-trihydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-
one from P. eryngii (DC.: FR.)3.  In an additional study the 
isolation of pleurone, ergosterol, (24E)-3β-
hydroxycucurbita-5,24-diene-26-oic acid and nicotinic 
acid were reported from P. eryngii var. ferulae4. 
Flammulina velutipes, also known as Enoki mushroom are 
sold in supermarkets throughout the Philippines.  Several 
studies were conducted on the chemical constituents of this 
mushroom. An earlier study reported that D-arabinitol, 
9(Z) oleic acid, 9(Z),12(Z) linoleic acid, ergosta-5,7,22-
trien-3β-ol, 5α,8α-epidioxy-ergosta-6,22-dien-3β-ol, 
3β,5α,9α-trihydroxy-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-one, 5-
hydroxymethyl-2-(1-methyl-ethenyl)-1-cyclohexanol, 
1,3-dilinolein and hemisceramide were isolated from F. 
velutipes5.  Furthermore, 5α,8α-epidioxy-(22E,24R)-
ergost-6,22-dien-3β-ol, ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-
one, sterpuric acid, mannitol and ribitol were obtained 
from this mushroom6. In another study, F. velutipes sterols 
(FVS) which mainly consisted of ergosterol (54.78%), 
22,23-dihydroergosterol (27.94%) and ergost-8(14)-ene-
3β-ol were reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against U251 
cells (IC50=23.42 μg/mL)7, This study is part of our 
research on the chemical constituents of Philippine edible 
mushrooms. We earlier reported the isolation of ergosterol, 
triacylglycerols and fatty acid methyl esters from P. 
djamor8 We also reported the isolation of ergosterol, 
ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, palmitic acid, stearic 
acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid, and 
dilinoleoyloleoylglycerol from P. florida9.  Furthermore, 
we recently reported the isolation of ergosterol and 
trilinolein from Lentinus edodes10. We report herein the 
isolation of ergosterol (1) and trilinolein (2) from the 
fruiting bodies of P. eryngii, while the fruiting bodies of F. 
velutipes yielded 1 and triacylglycerols (3).  The structures 
of 1-3 are presented in Fig. 1. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
General Experimental Procedure 
1H (500 MHz) and 13C (125 MHz) NMR spectra were 
acquired in CDCl3 on a 500 MHz Agilent DD2 NMR 
spectrometer with referencing to solvent signals (δ 7.26 
and 77.0 ppm). Column chromatography was performed 
with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh). Thin layer 
chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates 
coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized

by spraying with vanillin/H2SO4 solution followed by 
warming. 
Sample Collection 
The samples werepurchased from a supermarket in Metro 
Manila, Philippines in January 2016. They were 
authenticated as Pleurotus eryngii (DC.) Quél. and 
Flammulina velutipes (Curtis) Singer at the Botany 
Division, Philippine National Museum. 
General Isolation Procedure 
A glass column 18 inches in height and 1.0 inch internal 
diameter was packed with silica gel. The crude extracts 
were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using 
increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 
(10%increment) as eluents. Fifty milliliter fractions were 
collected. All fractions were monitored by thin layer 
chromatography. Fractions with spots of the same Rf  
values were combined and rechromatographed in 
appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were 
obtained. A glass column 12 inches in height and 0.5 inch 
internal diameter was used for the rechromatography. Two 
milliliter fractions were collected. Final purifications were 
conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. One milliliter 
fractions were collected. 
Isolation of the chemical constituents of the fruiting bodies 
of P. eryngii 
The freeze-dried fruiting bodies of P. eryngii (580 g) were 
ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and then 
filtered. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to 
afford a crude extract (1.36 g) which was chromatographed 
using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% 
increment. The CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed (2 
×) using 5% EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford 2 (6 mg). 
The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2 fraction was 
rechromatographed (2 ×) using 15% EtOAc in petroleum 
ether to yield 1 (9 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.   
Isolation of the chemical constituents of the fruiting bodies 
of F. velutipes 
The freeze-dried fruiting bodies of F. velutipes (300 g) 
were ground in a blender, soaked in CH2Cl2 for 3 days and 
then filtered. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to 
afford a crude extract (2.03 g) which was chromatographed 
using increasing proportions of acetone in CH2Cl2 at 10% 
increment.  The CH2Cl2 to 20% acetone in 
dichloromethane fractions were combined and 
rechromatographed (2 ×) using 5% EtOAc in petroleum  
ether to afford 3 (7 mg). The 30% acetone in CH2Cl2  
fraction was rechromatographed (3 ×) using 15% EtOAc 
in petroleum ether to yield 1 (5 mg) after washing with 
petroleum ether.   
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extracts 
of the fruiting bodies of Pleurotus eryngii and Flammulina 
velutipes led to the isolation of 1-3.  The NMR spectra of 
1 are in accordance with data reported in the literature for 
ergosterol11; 2 for trilinolein11; and 3 for triacylglycerol12.  
The fatty acids attached to the glycerol in 3 of F. velutipes 
were identified as linolenic acid, linoleic acid and oleic 
acid based on resonance intensities for the  methyl triplet 
at δ 0.96 (t, J = 7.8 Hz), the double allylic methylenes at δ 
2.78 and the olefinic protons at δ 5.34 (m) for the linolenic 
acid;  methyl triplet at δ 0.86 (t, J = 6.6 Hz), the double 
allylic methylene at δ 2.80 and the olefinic protons at δ 
5.34 (m) for the linoleic acid; and the methyl triplet at δ 
0.86 (t, J = 6.6 Hz) and the olefinic protons at δ 5.34 (m) 
for the oleic acid12. Literature search revealed that 1-3 
exhibited diverse biological activities. A study reported 
that ergosterol (1) provides significant protection against 
the promotion of bladder tumor induced by many types of 
promoters in the environment13. Moreover, the ergosterol 
content of brown and white button mushrooms correlated 
with their antioxidant activities14. In another study, 1 was 
reported to have the capability to inhibit lipid 
peroxidation15. Trilinolein (2) exhibits protective effects 
against cardiovascular disorders17. It also inhibits 
ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias and it exhibits 
anti-oxidant effect18.  It was also reported to inhibit the 
growth of human non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 and 
induce apoptosis in a dose- and time- dependent manne19. 
Another study reported that triglycerides showed a direct 
relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, 
which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to 
oxidation. Linoleic acid belongs to the omega-6 fatty acids. 
It was reported be a strong anticarcinogen in a number of 
animal models. It reduces risk of colon and breast cancer16 
and lowers cardiovascular disease risk and 
inflammations20. Triacylglycerols (3) exhibited 
antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. 
subtilis, C. albicans, and T. mentagrophytes25. Another 
study reported that triacylglycerols showed a direct

relationship between toxicity and increasing unsaturation, 
which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to 
oxidation26.  Linoleic acid belongs to the omega-6 fatty 
acids. It was reported to be a strong anticarcinogen in a 
number of animal models. It reduces the risk of colon and 
breast cancer27 and lowers cardiovascular disease risk and 
inflammations28.  Linolenic and linoleic acids inhibited 
parasites growth by 70% and 64% respectively, against P. 
berghei using the 4-day suppressive test. The two 
compounds, when used in combination, inhibited the 
parasites by 96% on day 4 of treatment29.
