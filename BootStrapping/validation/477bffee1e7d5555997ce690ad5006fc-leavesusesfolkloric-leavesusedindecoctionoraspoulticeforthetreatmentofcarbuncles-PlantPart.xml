hand, the proton resonating at 6.24 bonded to the third stereocenter at c-10 showed noesy correlation with h-7. consequently, the methyl ester group bound to this stereo carbon was oriented in the manner analogous to the bulky substituent of c-7 and c-8. thus, the relative stereochemistry of 1 is as shown in fig..</Pattern><Pattern>this was confirmed by the 13c nmr spectrum of chlorophyll a,
