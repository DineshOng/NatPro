  <Tag2>PlantPart<Name>in this study, the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of hoya meliflua yielded squalene, beta-amyrin , alpha-amyrin , lupeol , oleanone , ursenone , lupenone , beta-amyrin cinnamate , alpha-amyrin cinnamate , lupenyl cinnamate , beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol (figure 1).</Name>
    <Name>silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract from the leaves of hoya meliflua afforded squalene and mixtures of beta-amyrin , alpha-amyrin and lupeol in about 1:1:0.25 ratio; oleanone , ursenone and lupenone in about 1:1:0.3 ratio; beta-amyrin cinnamate , alpha-amyrin cinnamate and lupenyl cinnamate in about 0.5:0.3:1 ratio; and beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol in about 5:1 ratio.</Name>
    <Name>isolation of chemical constituents of the leaves the air-dried leaves (252.8 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in ch2cl2 for three days and then filtered.</Name>
    <Name>results: chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract from the leaves of hoya meliflua afforded squalene and mixtures of beta-amyrin , alpha-amyrin and lupeol in about 1:1:0.25 ratio; oleanone , ursenone and lupenone in about 1:1:0.3 ratio; beta-amyrin cinnamate , alpha-amyrin cinnamate and lupenyl cinnamate in about 0.5:0.3:1 ratio; and beta-sitosterol and stigmasterol in about 5:1 ratio. .: the results of our study indicate that hoya meliflua shares similar chemical characteristics with other members of the genus hoya.</Name>
