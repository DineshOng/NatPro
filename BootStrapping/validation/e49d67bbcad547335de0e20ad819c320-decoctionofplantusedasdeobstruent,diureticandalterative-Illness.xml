activity of bee venom is higher than that of npv.</Pattern><Pattern>the retention indices were computed for all the volatile constituents utilzing a homologous series of n-alkanes spla activity of naja philippinensis venom the secretory phospholipase a2 (spla) activity of npv was assessed using a commercially available kit (secretory phospholipase a2 assay kit cat.</Pattern><Pattern>the roots showed the high activity as exhibited by the ic50 value at 192.7 10.9 g/ml.</Pattern><Pattern>the sample wells consist of 10 l dtnb, 10 l npv (100 g/ml final concentration), and 5 l assay buffer.</Pattern><Pattern>the sample wells consisted of 5 l inhibitor in dmso, 10 l dtnb, and 10 l npv (100 g/ml final concentration).</Pattern><Pattern>the snake venom neutralization by constituents of plants like andrographis paniculata roots could be the first line of defense to the attenuation of the catalytic and hydrolytic properties of snake toxins which mitigate tissue damage and increase the life expectancy.</Pattern><Pattern>the spla activity for bee venom and npv were calculated using eq. . spla activity ( mol / minutes / ml 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-methyl-1,3-propanediyl ester, = a

determined against cobra venom spla using the assay kit described previously.</Pattern><Pattern>the spla activity of 100 g/ml npv was monitored in the presence of the inhibitors apr and ski.</Pattern><Pattern>the spla activity of npv was determined using a colorimetric assay in comparison with bee venom spla (positive control) and non-enzymatic controls (negative control).</Pattern><Pattern>the strong non-bonding interactions between ski and the proteins suggested that it is highly likely for ski to inhibit pla2 proteins.</Pattern><Pattern>the structure of ski was docked into the candidates using lamarkian genetic search algorithm.</Pattern><Pattern>the total volume per well was 225 l and the measurements were done in the triplicate.</Pattern><Pattern>therefore, the inhibition of pla2 proteins can reasonably explain the decreased venomous activity of the snake venom in the presence of ski.</Pattern><Pattern>this buffer system (diluted assay buffer) was used to reconstitute the substrate and samples for the assay.</Pattern><Pattern>this indicated that the presence of bound ca2+ is important in the binding of the
