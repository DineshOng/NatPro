    <Pattern>chemical investigation of the dichloromethane leaf extract led to the isolation of squalene , polyprenols , triglycerides , and beta-sitosterol 11.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>in a preliminary study on the cytotoxic activity of the dichloromethane extract of dysoxylum gaudichaudianum leaves, the crude extract exhibited cytotoxic activities with ic50 values of 13.19 and 7.35 g/ml for ht-29 and mcf-7 cancer cells, respectively.</Pattern>

    <Pattern>recently, we reported that the crude dicloromethane leaf extract of dysoxylum gaudichaudianum (a. juss.) miq exhibited ic50 values of 7.35 and 13.19 g/ml against breast cancer (mcf-7) and colon cancer (ht-29) cells, respectively.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>squalene , polyprenol , triglycerides , and beta-sitosterol , isolated from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of dysoxylum gaudichaudianum, were evaluated for their anti-proliferative activities against three human cancer cell lines, breast (mcf-7) and colon (ht-29 and hct-116), and a normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast neonatal (hdfn) using the in vitro prestoblue cell viability assay.</Pattern>
