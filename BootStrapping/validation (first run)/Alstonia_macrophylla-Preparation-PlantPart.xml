    <Name>the water decoction of aas inhibited vrv minimum lethal action, minimum edema activity, minimal defibrinogenating activity, and minimum necrotizing action in mice weighing approximately 18-20 g. in this work, alstonia macrophylla bark was found to be an efficient antioxidant, the assessment of the effectiveness of alstonia macrophylla on the four immortalized cancer cell lines revealed that the integrity of mcf-7, h69pr, and ht-29 consistently decreased in all the trials, and the action of cytotoxicity was analogous to the positive control zeocin.</Name>
    <Name>when mixed with water, the powdered bark can be used as an astringent and for treating skin diseases.</Name>

    <Name>in its powdered form, the bark of alstonia macrophylla (alstonia macrophylla), also known as hard milkwood or batino, is used in wine preparation and as an antipyretic, traditional remedy and preventive concoction, medicine for dysentery, an aid in the menstrual cycle, treatment in alzheimer's disease through down regulation of acetylcholine, and in wound healing.</Name>
    <Name>the bark was ground followed by soaking 3.0 g of the powdered biomass in 20 ml of dichloromethane (dcm) for 3 h. extracts were filtered and then dried under nitrogen for 1 h. the crude extract yielded approximately 0.7 g. powdered biomass of each species was soaked in a polar extraction solvent to target the isolation of phenolic acids.</Name>
