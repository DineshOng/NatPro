ABSTRACT: The objective of this research was to find the possible pharmacognosy of the <orgpart>bark</orgpart> of the Philippine <species>Alstonia macrophylla</species> Wall ex G.Don (<species>AM</species>).

Gas chromatographicmass spectral (GCEI-MS) characterization and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed to detect the bioactive constituents.

EDX analysis of <species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> displayed a high content of potassium (3.26%) and calcium (2.96%).

Eight constituents were detected in <species>AM</species> crude dichloromethane (DCM) extracts, which consisted of a long-chain <compound>unsaturated fatty acid</compound> (17:0) and <compound>fatty acid esters</compound> such as ethyl <compound>hexadecanoate</compound> and methyl <compound>hexadecanoate</compound>.

Extraction of <species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> using <compound>methanol</compound> and <compound>dimethyl</compound> <compound>sulfoxide</compound> (MeOH/DMSO) solvents resulted in the identification of 17 constituents, principally <class>alkaloids</class> (<compound>alstonerine</compound>, 34.38%; <compound>strictamin</compound>, 5.23%; <compound>rauvomitin</compound>, 4.29%; and <compound>brucine</compound>, 3.66%) and <class>triterpenoids</class> (<compound>gamma-sitosterol</compound>, 3.85%; <compound>lupeol</compound>, 3.00%; <compound>24-methylenecycloartanol</compound>, 2.81%; <compound>campesterol</compound>, 2.71%; <compound>beta-amyrin</compound>, 2.30%; and <compound>stigmasterol</compound>, 2.13%).

MeOH/DMSO samples of <species>AM</species> were used in the selected bioassays.

The samples exhibited efficient free radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.71 mg/mL) and were noncytotoxic to normal HDFn (IC50 > 100 g/mL) and neoplastic <cell>THP-1</cell> cell lines (IC50 = 67.22 g/mL) while highly degenerative to <cell>MCF-7</cell> (IC50 = 6.34 g/mL), <cell>H69PR</cell> (IC50 = 7.05 g/mL), and <cell>HT-29</cell> (IC50 = 9.10 g/mL).

Most interestingly, the <species>AM</species> samples inhibited the northern Philippine Cobras (<species>Naja philippinensis</species> Taylor) venom (IC50 = 297.27 9.33 g/mL) through a secretory phospholipase A2 assay.

INTRODUCTION Medicinal plants are still widely used in nonindustrialized societies such as in many parts of <location>Southeast Asia</location> because they are readily available and cheaper than modern medicines.

In the <location>Philippines</location>, some of the most important and highly recognized medicinal plants belong to genus <species>Alstonia in</species> the family <family>Apocynaceae</family>.

Two of its five Philippine native species, <species>Alstonia macrophylla</species> Wall ex G.Don and <species>Alstonia scholaris</species> (L.) R. Br., are locally important, and various organs of these plants are harvested as natural remedies for human ailments.

Both <species>A. macrophylla</species> and <species>A. scholaris</species> were reported to contain <compound>echitovenidine</compound>, <compound>echitamine</compound>, <compound>venenatine</compound> (an <class>indole alkaloid</class>), and <bioact>anti-inflammatory</bioact> <class>triterpenoids</class>.

The <orgpart>bark</orgpart> of the <species>A. scholaris</species>, the most intensively used organ of this species, was recently found to have strong <bioact>antifungal</bioact> activity.

It was also found to relieve anxietyand stress-related incidences through stabilization of distress-induced physiological deviations seen in mice plasma.

In its <prep>powdered</prep> form, the <orgpart>bark</orgpart> of <species>A. macrophylla</species> (<species>AM</species>), also known as <aka>hard milkwood or batino</aka>, is used in wine preparation and as an antipyretic, traditional remedy and preventive concoction, medicine for dysentery, an aid in the menstrual cycle, treatment in Alzheimers disease through down regulation of <compound>acetylcholine</compound>, and in <illness>wound</illness> healing.

When <prep>mixed</prep> with water, the <prep>powdered</prep> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> can be used as an astringent and for treating skin diseases.

Apart from the <orgpart>bark</orgpart>, <prep>crushed</prep> <orgpart>leaves</orgpart> of <species>AM</species>, when <prep>mixed</prep> with copra oil and warmed, were applied as heated dressings to joint and muscle injuries.

Moreover, decoctions of its undeveloped <orgpart>aerial plant parts</orgpart> were ingested as a curative for respiratory and auditory obstructions.

<prep>Mixed</prep> preparations of <orgpart>leaves</orgpart> and <orgpart>stem bark</orgpart> of <species>AM</species> were used in the <location>Republic of India</location> to treat upset stomachs, Received: January 10, 2019 Accepted: May 17, 2019 Published: May 30, 2019 2019 American Chemical Society 9488 DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.b 00082 ACS Omega 2019, 4, 94889496 D ow nl oa de d vi a 12 4.

Similar to <species>A. scholaris</species>, <species>AM</species> <orgpart>leaves</orgpart> <prep>extracted</prep> with <compound>methanol</compound> similarly exhibited <bioact>antimicrobial</bioact> properties.

A variety of phytochemical analytes have been reported from distinct organs of <species>AM</species>.

Phytochemical investigations of <species>AM</species> afforded <class>steroid alcohols</class>, <class>isoprenoids</class>, hydroxylated polyphenolic compounds, <class>alkaloids</class>, tannic acids, and <compound>monosaccharides</compound>.

<species>AM</species> was found to be rich in <compound>beta-sitosterol</compound>, a <class>phytosterol</class> that is an effective inhibitor of semen movability, and has possible use as a family planning medicine for women.

A study of the <orgpart>aerial parts</orgpart> reported 19 alkaloidal compounds, 15 of which were elucidated.

In another study, also using <orgpart>leaf</orgpart> extracts yielded 10 undiscovered <class>indole alkaloids</class>, <compound>alstomaline</compound>, <compound>10,11-dimethoxynareline</compound>, <compound>alstohentine</compound>, <compound>alstomicine</compound>, <compound>16-hydroxyalstonisine</compound>, 16hydroxyalstonal, 16-hydroxy-N4-demethyl<compound>alstophyllal</compound> oxindole, <compound>alstophyllal</compound>, <compound>6-oxoalstophylline</compound>, and <compound>6-oxoalstophyllal</compound>, in consort with 21 others already discovered by a previous study.

Like <species>A. scholaris</species>, <species>AM</species> also has abundant <class>alkaloids</class>.

To date, nearly 70 dissimilar categories of <class>alkaloid</class> derivatives have been described in various organs of <species>AM</species>, and a majority of them were isolated from the <orgpart>stem bark</orgpart>.

In this work, we established the <bioact>antioxidant</bioact> (by a modified assay using <compound>1,1-diphenyl</compound>-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)), <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> (<cell>HT-29</cell>, <cell>H69PR</cell>, <cell>MCF-7</cell>, <cell>THP-1</cell> immortalized cell lines, and normal HDFn primary culture cells), and <bioact>antivenom</bioact> activities of crude <species>AM</species> extracts.

Chemical characterization was achieved utilizing gas chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

After our thorough investigation, we believe that this original work is the first to describe the research of these selected bioassay experiments of crude <species>AM</species> extracts using a MeOH/DMSO solvent extraction protocol of <species>A. macrophylla</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart>.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1.

GCEI-MS Assessments of <species>AM</species>.

Gas chromatographicmass spectral examinations of the DCM preparations of <species>AM</species> detected the presence of eight analytes.

The verified volatile constituents of the reaction mixture were confirmed through retention index (RI) and structural category via the NIST Archive.

In Table 1, the findings are enumerated corresponding to peak succession visualization on an HP-5 ms column.

The sample, seen in Table 1 and Figure 1, consisted chiefly of a <compound>fatty acid</compound> and <compound>fatty acid esters</compound>: <compound>heptadecanoic acid</compound> (16.61%); <compound>hexadecanoic acid</compound> <compound>ethyl ester</compound> (12.21%); and <compound>hexadecanonic acid</compound> <compound>methyl ester</compound> (10.46%).

The MEOH/DMSO crude <species>AM</species> extracts were composed primarily of <class>alkaloids</class> (Table 2 and Figure 1): <compound>alstonerine</compound> (34.38%), <compound>strictamin</compound> (5.23%), <compound>rauvomitin</compound> (4.29%), and <compound>brucine</compound> (3.66%).

Other notable constituents from this polar <prep>extract</prep> were <class>triterpenoids</class>: <compound>gamma-sitosterol</compound> (3.85%), <compound>lupeol</compound> (3.00%), <compound>24-methylenecycloartanol</compound> (2.81%), <compound>campesterol</compound> (2.71%), <compound>beta-amyrin</compound> (2.30%), and <compound>stigmasterol</compound> (2.13%).

Since more bioactive phytochemicals were found in the MEOH/ DMSO crude <species>AM</species> extracts, extracts using this solvent extraction technique were used in all the subsequent bioassays.

2.2.

EDX Analysis of <species>AM</species>.

The chemical compositions of the adsorbents were found to have an elemental percentage (<ppm) of K (3.26%), Ca (2.96%), Cl (0.93%), S (0.60%), Si (0.47%), P (0.30%), Fe (0.05%), Mn (0.03%), and Zn (0.04%) with glucose, C6H10O5, making up 91.36%.

Elevated percentages of potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) suggest that the plant metabolized high consumption of mineral nutrients absorbed from the soil of the sample as demonstrated in Figure 2.

Assessments linking calcium ingestion in healthy elderly women were determined to ameliorate lipid panels, sugar metabolic rate, and normalization of <illness>hypertension</illness>.

The increase in the consumption of potassium-rich foods has been well established to regulate cardiovascular anomalies, alleviate orthopedic and renal diseases, and prevent strokes.

Other genera from the <family>Apocynaceae</family> family were subjected to EDX analyses.

The pulverized aerial material and nodal and internodal <orgpart>bark</orgpart> <prep>powder</prep> (2.0 g) of <species>Grewia lasiocarpa</species> E.Mey ex Harv underwent elemental analyses using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), connected to software operated by the Aztec system from Oxford Instruments (<location>U.K.</location>).

Twentytwo elements were found present, of which three foremost essential elements were obtained [sodium (Na), sulfur (S), and calcium (Ca)].

Fifteen residual metals [chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), <compound>iodine</compound> (I), potassium (K), molybdenum (Mo), silicon (Si), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), selenium (Se), and vanadium (V)] and five transition elements [arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), rubidium (Rb), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)] were present.

Elemental investigations performed on <prep>powdered</prep> <orgpart>leaves</orgpart>, <orgpart>stems</orgpart>, and <orgpart>roots</orgpart> of Ichnocarpus f rutescens wherein copper sample remnants were prepared pursuant to coating with a gold sputter coater.

Elemental analyses were restricted to eleven elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Zn).

The mineral content for the <orgpart>roots</orgpart> displayed the presence of all the specified elements; however, the <orgpart>leaves</orgpart> were deficient in iron and aluminum, and the <orgpart>stem</orgpart> was deficient in magnesium.25 2.3.

<bioact>Antioxidant</bioact> Activity of <species>AM</species>.

<species>AM</species> crude extracts were found to be effective free radical scavengers given that the IC50 value was low at 0.71 mg/mL (Figure 3).

A previous report showed that three chief constituents purified from the <compound>methanol</compound>ic fraction of <species>A. macrophylla</species> <orgpart>leaf</orgpart>, specifically <compound>betasitosterol</compound>, <compound>ursolic acid</compound>, and <compound>beta-sitosteryl</compound>-beta-D-glucoside, as well as a minor fraction found to have <class>alkaloid</class> and <compound>fatty acids</compound> were the entities that induced <bioact>antioxidant</bioact> activity at an effective concentration of 200 mg/kg (DPPH protocol evaluations, <compound>superoxide</compound> anion quenching experiments, and DNA cleavage assay).17 2.4.

Cytotoxicity Assays.

The cytotoxicity of the crude <prep>extract</prep> of <species>AM</species> was investigated on <cell>MCF-7</cell>, <cell>H69PR</cell>, <cell>HT-29</cell>, Table 1.

Analyses of the cytotoxicity of <species>AM</species> done on normal HDFn resulted in IC50 values exceeding 100 g/mL.

<location>Zeocin</location>, a DNA intercalating agent, was used as the positive control in all the trials.

An illustration of the percent of intact live cells as a correlation to the inverse function to exponentiation of the concentrations used can be found in Figures 4 and 5.

The characteristic inhibitory doseresponse, which is a sigmoidal curve or function, was found in generally most of the charts.

Plots comparing the <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> properties of <species>AM</species> and <location>Zeocin</location> on the viability of each specific cell line are found in Figure 4.

IC50 values of the isolates and the positive control are synopsized in Table 3.

Crude extracts of <species>AM</species> gave the highest <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> efficacy toward <cell>MCF-7</cell> with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.34 g/mL, which was followed by <cell>H69PR</cell>, <cell>HT-29</cell>, and <cell>THP-1</cell> with IC50 values of 7.05, 9.10, and 67.22 g/mL, respectively.

Significant differences for the degree of potency, as found in <location>Tukeys</location> post hoc multiple comparison, were found between almost all cell lines (p < 0.05) except for the paired treatment of <cell>MCF-7</cell> versus <cell>H69PR</cell>, which was displayed to be statistically similar (p > 0.05).

Data subsets of aforementioned cancer cell lines and <location>Zeocin</location> exhibited that the paired treatments were comparable (p > 0.05).

There were no perceivable variances as found in the unpaired t test between the paired trials of <species>AM</species> versus <location>Zeocin</location> (p > 0.05) in <cell>MCF-7</cell> trials.

In fact, there was no significant difference in the scores for mean values of <species>AM</species> (M = 53.02, <species>SD</species> = 5.71) and mean values for <location>Zeocin</location> (M = 58.69, <species>SD</species> = 5.67) conditions; t (14) = 0.7047, p = 0.4925.

These results exhibited that the antiproliferative actions of both <species>AM</species> and <location>Zeocin</location> were comparable.

Trials using <cell>H69PR</cell> showed that the <species>AM</species> <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> activity was comparable to <location>Zeocin</location> displaying no significant differences between the two inhibitors (p > 0.05) as found through an independent sample t test comparison.

Results for the unpaired t test exhibited the mean values of <species>AM</species> (M = 52.02, <species>SD</species> = 5.44) and mean values for <location>Zeocin</location> (M = 58.22, <species>SD</species> = 6.54) conditions (t (14) = 0.7285, p = 0.4783).

Post hoc analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between the paired treatments (p > 0.05) of <cell>HT-29</cell> of <species>AM</species> and <location>Zeocin</location>.

ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.b 00082 ACS Omega 2019, 4, 94889496 9490 Missing in text-> treated with <species>AM</species> (M = 49.16, <species>SD</species> = 7.27) and mean IC50 values of <cell>HT-29</cell> cells treated with <location>Zeocin</location> (M = 60.38, <species>SD</species> = 7.75) were found not to have significant variance (t(14) = 1.056, p = 0.3090).

The global or shared results of <cell>THP-1</cell> with inhibitor trials reject the null hypothesis and exemplifies that both data subsets are unique (p < 0.05).

Significant differences were seen between the two inhibitors (p < 0.05), and the results for the unpaired t test disclosed the values of <species>AM</species> (M = 32.31, <species>SD</species> = 5.10) and for <location>Zeocin</location> (M = 61.67, <species>SD</species> = 9.17) conditions (t (14) = 2.798, p = 0.0142).

<species>AM</species> was established to be noncytotoxic to normal HDFn, with an IC50 value substantially surpassing concentrations of 100 g/mL.

Multiple comparisons of <species>AM</species> and immortalized cell line examinations confirmed that there were significant differences and, the null hypothesis (one curve for all datasets) was rejected (log IC50 the same for all datasets) as verified by the goodness of fit of the two alternative nested models (IC50) between separate experiments, F (4, 80) = 445.2, p < 0.0001, and to the discrepancies amid the doseresponse diagrams F (4, 35) = 4.176, p = 0.0072.

Similarly, pertaining to their respective IC50 results, trials with aberrant cell lines treated with <location>Zeocin</location> were found to not be significantly disparate (p > 0.05).

<location>Zeocin</location>, a known <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> agent, gave IC50 values of 3.37, 3.83, 3.78, 3.59, and 4.08 ppm in <cell>MCF-7</cell>, <cell>H69PR</cell>, HT29, <cell>THP-1</cell>, and HDFn, respectively.

Multiple comparisons showed negative noteworthy variances in the trials (p > 0.05).

Post hoc comparison of the doseresponse curve fits for the aberrant cell line treatments exhibited no significant differences (Figures 4 and 5).

At present, only the <compound>sulforhodamine</compound> B (SRB) colorimetric assays for cytotoxicity screening were done on the <orgpart>bark</orgpart> or outer covering of <orgpart>roots</orgpart> but not on <species>A. macrophylla</species> tree <orgpart>bark</orgpart>.

Results from the literature stated that indole derivatives found in the rhizome outer covering of <species>A. macrophylla</species> had antiproliferative action (using the SRB assay) on MOR-P and <cell>COR-L23</cell> carcinomas because of the bisindole component.

O-Acetylmacralstonine, <compound>villalstonine</compound>, and <compound>macrocarpamine</compound> were also established to influence definite actions on normal mammary fibroblasts, as well as on these specific immortalized cancers: StMl 1a (skin cancer), Caki-2 (<bodypart>kidney</bodypart> cancer), <cell>MCF-7</cell> (<bodypart>breast</bodypart> cancer), and <cell>LS174T</cell> (colon cancer) with IC50 values ranging 210 M. Another work showed that <compound>methanol</compound>ic extracts of <orgpart>root</orgpart> barks containing Omethylmacralstonine, <compound>talcarpine</compound>, <compound>villalstonine</compound>, <compound>pleiocarpamine</compound>, and <compound>macraistonine</compound> exhibited high cytotoxicity on MOR-P and <cell>COR-L23</cell>.27 2.5.

Inhibitory sPLA Activity of <species>AM</species>.

The sPLA action of 100 ppm <species>N. philippinensis</species> (NPV) was examined with the potential inhibitor <species>AM</species>.

Plant extracts ranging from 1 to 1000 g/mL (seven dilutions) were established in the presence of 100 g/mL Philippine cobra venom.

Percent inhibition brought about by the inhibitors was determined and established on the computed sPLA activities.

The <species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> showed inhibitory phospholipase activity as shown by the IC50 concentration of 297.27 9.33 g/mL Figure 2.

ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.b 00082 ACS Omega 2019, 4, 94889496 9491 (Figure 6).

An <class>alkaloid</class> found in the <family>Solanaceae</family> family, <compound>atropine</compound>, was discovered to impede the venom of <species>Daboia russelli</species>.

Phytochemical compounds, coumestan and steroids (<compound>beta-sitosterol</compound> and <compound>stigmasterol</compound>) <prep>extracted</prep> from the alcoholic rhizome preparations of <species>Pluchea indica</species> bypassed oxidative degradation of lipids and <compound>superoxide</compound> dismutase action stimulated through envenoming.

Lupeol moderately prevented the hemorrhage, edema, procoagulant, and myotoxic events caused by <species>Bothrops venom</species>.

These aforementioned constituents could be the cause for the observed <species>N. philippinensis</species> <bioact>antivenom</bioact> activity, which solicits further studies.

A member of the same genus, <species>A. scholaris</species> (AAS) aqueous solution was found to significantly neutralize <species>Vipera russelli</species> venom (VRV) stimulating an increase in serum <compound>alanine</compound> transaminase, <compound>aspartate</compound> transaminase, and <compound>creatinine</compound> in Swiss albino animal models incubated with VRV (0.5 and 1 g) and AAS concoction (200 mg/kg).

The water <prep>decoction</prep> of AAS inhibited VRV minimum lethal action, minimum edema activity, minimal defibrinogenating activity, and minimum necrotizing action in mice weighing approximately 1820 g.

In this work, <species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> was found to be an efficient <bioact>antioxidant</bioact>, the assessment of the effectiveness of <species>AM</species> on the four immortalized cancer cell lines revealed that the integrity of <cell>MCF-7</cell>, <cell>H69PR</cell>, and <cell>HT-29</cell> consistently decreased in all the trials, and the action of cytotoxicity was analogous to the positive control <location>Zeocin</location>.

For the most part, trials observed in the mutant cell lines indicated low half maximal inhibitory concentrations (<7 g/mL), which were acquired for all of the Figure 4.

<cell>MCF-7</cell> was highly responsive to <species>AM</species>, while the least responsive to <species>AM</species> was <cell>THP-1</cell>.

Wild-type HDFn trials incubated with <species>AM</species> were substantiated to be noncytotoxic and gave half maximal inhibitory concentrations of greater than 100 g/mL, whereas Zeocin-treated normal cells reached their half maximal inhibitory concentrations at less than 5.00 g/ mL.

The results of this work on the crude MEOH/DMSO extracts from <species>A. macrophylla</species>, which consisted primarily of <class>alkaloids</class> and <class>triterpenoids</class>, could be the rationale for further development of this preparation, through additional bioassays, as a candidate for chemotherapeutic drugs or as a supplementation in the management of human colorectal cancer, human <bodypart>breast</bodypart> adenocarcinoma, and human small cell lung carcinoma.

<species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> has shown in vitro prohibitory events against sPLA granting that there has been no preceding information of this phenomenon.

NPV neutralization by constituents of <species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> or in combination therapy with <bioact>antivenom</bioact> serum could be suitable inhibitors to the enzymatic toxins from snake envenoming.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 3.1.

Sample Preparation Protocol.

The outer coverings of <species>A. macrophylla</species> <orgpart>trunks</orgpart> were gathered in <location>Mariveles, Bataan, Philippines</location> and was identified by Virgilio Linis, a botanist from the Biology Department, De La Salle University.

The <orgpart>bark</orgpart> was <prep>ground</prep> followed by soaking 3.0 g of the <prep>powdered</prep> biomass in 20 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) for 3 h. Extracts were <prep>filtered</prep> and then dried under nitrogen for 1 h.

The crude <prep>extract</prep> yielded approximately 0.7 g. <prep>Powdered</prep> biomass of each species was soaked in a polar extraction solvent to target the isolation of <compound>phenolic acid</compound>s.

This solution was made up of a 50:50 MeOH/DMSO ratio according to the method used by Harukaze et al.19 3.2.

GCEI-MS Parameters.

Crude extracts from both solvents were scrutinized by GCEI-MS.

An Agilent GC MS 7890B, equipped with a HP-5 ms (5% <compound>phenyl</compound> methylsiloxane) Ultra Inert column (30 m 250 mm 0.25 mm) with ultrapure helium gas as the mobile phase, was employed for the analysis of low-boiling-point components.

Helium gas was delivered at 1 mL/min, while maintaining pressure at 8.2 psi, with a rate of 36.62 cm/s and holdup interval of 1.37 min.

The splitless inlet was held at 250 C, at 8.2 psi, and an overall stream of 24 mL/min, with a septum purge stream velocity of 3 mL/min.

The temperature for the injector was stipulated at 250 C.

The temperature program started at 70 C with a programmed linear ramp of 2 C/min until 135 C and was held at this temperature for 10 min.

Another temperature increase was achieved at 4 C/min until 220 C and was maintained for 10 min.

The temperature was then increased to 270 C at a ramp of 3.

C/min and was held at 37 min.

Compound identification was done using the NIST Archive 2.0, and percent peak area average was calculated from the subsequent total ion chromatograms (TIC).

The consequential results were authenticated by the evaluation of the constituents corresponding to their elution succession with their comparative retention indices on a midpolar column.

Doseresponse curves were formed from data points as mean SEM.

The GraphPad Prism 7.01 software was applied to perform the extra sum-of-squares F test to (A) gauge the implication of the best-fit-parameter of IC50 values between separate treatments and to (B) ascertain the variances amid the doseresponse curve congruency.

<species>AM</species>, (A) F (4, 80) = 445.2, p < 0.0001 (B) F (4, 35) = 4.176, p = 0.0072.

The unpaired two-tailed t test was the treatment employed for each cell line to evaluate the significant variances among the data groups.

The statistical data were as follows: <cell>MCF-7</cell>, t (14) = 0.7047, p = 0.4925; <cell>H69PR</cell>, t (14) = 0.7285, p = 0.4783; <cell>HT-29</cell>, t (14) = 1.056, p = 0.3090; <cell>THP-1</cell>, t (14) = 2.798, p = 0.0142; HDFn, t (14) = 3.761, p = 0.0021.

ACS Omega Article DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.b 00082 ACS Omega 2019, 4, 94889496 9493 indices were processed for the identified analytes utilizing a sequence of n-alkanes.

All tests were performed in triplicate.

3.3.

EDX Analysis.

Dehydrated samples of <species>AM</species> <orgpart>bark</orgpart> were prepared in a 10 mm Mylar cup for elemental analysis using an EDX-7000 with a collimator set at 10 mm under vacuum.

3.4.

<bioact>Antioxidant</bioact> Assay.

The <bioact>antioxidant</bioact> potential of protonated <species>AM</species> <orgpart>leaf</orgpart> <compound>methanol</compound>ic preparations was measured by an adapted DPPH (<compound>1,1-diphenyl</compound>-2-picrylhydrazyl) protocol of Viturro et al.

Approximately 0.5 g of <prep>powdered</prep> biomass of each species was added to 1 mL of an extraction solvent made up of 7.0 mL of MeOH, 2.95 mL of H2O, and 0.05 mL of HCl.

The biomass was soaked for 3 h and was <prep>filtered</prep> to yield approximately 50 mg of crude <prep>extract</prep>.

Samples were then dried under nitrogen gas for 2 h.

The DPPH mixture (0.2 mM) was formulated by diluting 3.94 mg of DPPH in 50 mL of <compound>methanol</compound>.

An initial solution of <species>AM</species> was prepared at 4 mg of crude <prep>extract</prep> in 1 mL of <compound>methanol</compound>.

The blank was made with 1 mL of this solution in addition to 1 mL of <compound>methanol</compound>.

One mL of the 4 mg/mL stock was added to a 10 mL test tube along with 1 mL of the 0.2 mM DPPH solution.

A total of eight concentrations from 17.5 to 0.27 mg/mL were made by serial dilution.

The absorbances were read at 515 nm (UVvis Shimadzu 2900) after samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min.

IC50 is defined as the sample concentration at which 50% of the free radicals are removed.

This is determined by calculating the DPPH free radical scavenging percentages.

This is computed by the formula: A A A DPPH scavenging effect (%) or percent inhibition ( / ) 1000 1 0= (1) 3.5.

Cell Viability Assay.

The pharmacognosy of the dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) extracts from <species>AM</species> was tested on the succeeding immortalized cell lines purchased from ATCC, <location>Manassas, Virginia, USA</location> (<bodypart>breast</bodypart> cancer (<cell>MCF-7</cell>), colon cancer (HT29), small cell lung carcinoma (<cell>H69PR</cell>), human acute monocytic leukemia (<cell>THP-1</cell>)) and a primary culture of normal human dermal fibroblast neonatal (HDFn) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, <location>USA</location>).

Culture and maintenance were done in DMEM (Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium and 10% fetal bovine serum with 1 antibiotic antimycotic) (Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen, <location>USA</location>) and were incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.

The <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> activities of the <species>AM</species> extracts were determined using the PrestoBlue viability assay.

The protocol detects viable cells by virtue of actively present mitochondrial reductases that metabolically reduce the <compound>resazurin</compound> dye (nonfluorescent blue) to resorufin (highly fluorescent red).

The 96 well culture plates were measured at 570 nm to measure the resorufin produced, which was correlated to the number of viable cells.

Cells passaged in wells with viable counts of 1.0 104 cells/ mL in each well were allowed to form monolayers overnight, except for <cell>THP-1</cell> that are nonadherent cells.

After overnight incubation,100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, and 0.78 g/mL solutions of <species>AM</species> extracts were introduced into the wells.

After 72 h, 10 L of PrestoBlue was placed in the trials.

Further incubation was done for 1 h to allow optimal reactions to take place.

Wells with no <species>AM</species> added served as negative untreated controls, and wells with <location>Zeocin</location> (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gibco, <location>USA</location>) served as the positive control.

<location>Zeocin</location>, which is a DNA intercalating antibiotic of the bleomycin/phleomycin family, is <bioact>cytotoxic</bioact> to cells growing aerobically from 0.5 to 1000 g/mL.

Spectrophotometry was carried out using a BioTek ELx800.

Optical density (O.D.) values were ascertained to derive percent cell viability following the equation below: cell viability(%) (O. D. O. D. ) (O. D. O. D. ) 100570nm,treated sample 570nm,blank 570nm,negative control 570nm,blank = (2) Nonlinear regression and statistical analyses were achieved using the software GraphPad Prism 7.

The IC50 (inhibitor concentration leading to 50% reduction of cell viability) was also inferred from nonlinear regression analysis.

All trials were performed in three replicates and are shown as mean SEM.

The BrownForsythe analysis (F test) was utilized to discern the variances in the best-fit parameters and doseresponse curve fits.

One-way ANOVA (p < 0.05) was accomplished to clarify disparities between datasets, in conjunction with <location>Tukeys</location> post hoc test (p < 0.05).

3.6.

In Vitro Inhibitory sPLA Activity.

The inhibitory effects of <species>AM</species> (MeOH/DMSO) extracts were determined against northern Philippine Cobra or <species>Naja philippinensis</species> Taylor (NPV) venom sPLA using the Secretory Phospholipase A2 Assay Kit (Cat.

No ab133089).

The following reagents were used and formulated according to the manufacturers instructions: assay buffer (10), <compound>5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid</compound>) (DTNB), diheptanoyl thio-PC substrate, bee venom (control), and a 96 well <compound>polystyrene</compound> F-bottom clear <compound>microplate</compound>.

The venoms and <species>AM</species> were reconstituted in <compound>methanol</compound> or DMSO to achieve a 100 mg/mL concentration, which was serially diluted to1000 to 1 ppm.

The blank was composed of 5 L of DMSO, 10 L of DTNB, and 10 L of assay buffer, while the positive control contained 5 L of DMSO, 10 L of DTNB, and 10 L of NPV.

The experimental wells included 5 L of <species>AM</species> inhibitor in DMSO, 10 L of DTNB, and 10 L of NPV.

After addition of 200 L of diheptanoyl thio-PC substrate into each well, absorbance was read at 414 nm using a Corona Electric Multimode Microplate Reader (MTP-800).

Percent inhibition was verified based on the determined sPLA inhibition.

In addition, the concentration of <species>AM</species> generating 50% inhibition (IC50) was stated.

X X X %inhibition <compound>100control</compound> sample control = (3) Here, Xcontrol is the sPLA activity of positive control (100 g/L NPV) and Xsample is the sPLA activity in the presence of inhibitor (<species>AM</species>).

The absorbance values were corrected against the blank sample (DMSO).
