Cycas, the only currently known <MedicinalPlant>genus</MedicinalPlant> of the Family <Family>Cycadaceae</Family>, are considered as fossil plants though they may have evolved only about 12 million years ago.

The cycads resemble palms in morphology and are commonly called <MedicinalPlant>sago palm</MedicinalPlant>.

These are widely distributed in the <Location>Tropics</Location>, with species found in <Location>Asia</Location>, <Location>Africa</Location>, Southeast <Location>Asia</Location>, <Location>Pacific</Location>, and <Location>Australia</Location>.

They also grow on volcanic, limestone, ultramafic, sandy, or even water-logged soils in grassland and forest habitats (Madulid and Agoo, 2009).

In the <Location>Philippines</Location>, there are eleven cycad species namely, <Synonym>Cycas aenigma</Synonym> K. D. Hill & Lindstrom, <Synonym>Cycas curranii</Synonym> (J. Schust.) K. D. Hill, <Synonym>Cycas edentata</Synonym> de Laub., <Synonym>Cycas lacrimans</Synonym> Lindstrom & K. D. Hill, <Synonym>Cycas nitida</Synonym> K. D.

<Synonym>Cycas revoluta</Synonym>, a widely cultivated species, is an introduced species from <Location>Japan</Location> and <Location>Taiwan</Location>.

The demand of Cycas species for domestic and international horticultural trade, grassland and forest fires of anthropogenic origin, and conversion of their natural habitats to settlements and other land uses have threatened to varying degrees the wild populations of the <MedicinalPlant>genus</MedicinalPlant> (IUCN 2010).

Some of these species which have been assessed and evaluated in the 2010 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species are <Synonym>Cycas curranii</Synonym> , <Synonym>Cycas wadei</Synonym> and <Synonym>Cycas zambalensis</Synonym> as Critically Endangered (CR) , <Synonym>Cycas riuminiana</Synonym> as Endangered (E) , and <Synonym>Cycas saxatilis</Synonym> as Vulnerable .

<Synonym>Cycas sancti-lasallei</Synonym> (<Family>Cycadaceae</Family>) is a new species from <Location>Mindanao</Location>, <Location>Philippines</Location> (Agoo and Madulid, 2012).

There are no reported chemical and biological activity studies on Cycas sancti-lasallei.

However, some Cycas species have been studied for their chemical constituents and biological activities.

The most studied Cycas are <Synonym>Cycas revoluta</Synonym> Thunb and <Synonym>Cycas circinalis</Synonym> which contain the carcinogenic toxin cycasin (Nishida et al., 1956; Laqueur et al., 1963).

The methanolic <Preparation>extract</Preparation> of the leaflets of <Synonym>Cycas circinalis</Synonym> L. and the chloroform <Preparation>extract</Preparation> of <Synonym>Cycas revoluta</Synonym> Thunb yielded <ChemicalClass>biflavonoids</ChemicalClass>, lignans, flavan-3-ols, <Compound>flavone-C-glucosides</Compound>, nor-isoprenoids, and a <ChemicalClass>flavanone</ChemicalClass>.

Other studies reported that <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound> showed cytostatic activity against <CellLine>Hep-2</CellLine> and <CellLine>McCoy</CellLine> cells , markedly inhibited tumour promotion in two stage carcinogenesis experiments , exhibited antimutagenic , topical <BioAct>anti-inflammatory</BioAct> , antiosteoarthritic and <BioAct>antioxidant</BioAct> activities.

<Compound>Triacylglycerides</Compound> exhibited <BioAct>antimicrobial</BioAct> activity against <Synonym>S. aureus</Synonym>, <Synonym>P. aeruginosa</Synonym>, <Synonym>B. subtilis</Synonym>, <Synonym>Cycas albicans</Synonym>, and <Synonym>T. mentagrophytes</Synonym>.

Another study reported that <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> showed a direct relationship between 016 Antonio Ng et al. / Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Science <Compound>beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters</Compound>, (Suppl <Compound>squalene</Compound>, ; 2015: 012-017 toxicity and increasing unsaturation, which in turn correlated with increasing susceptibility to oxidation (Ferruzzi and Blakeslee, 2007).

<Compound>The fatty acids</Compound> esterified to the <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> were deduced to be <Compound>oleic acid</Compound>, <Compound>linoleic acid</Compound> and <Compound>linolenic acid</Compound>.

<Compound>Oleic acid</Compound> has been reported to be responsible for the reduction of blood pressure induced by olive oil.

<Compound>Oleic acid</Compound> may hinder the progression of adrenoleukodystrophy, a fatal disease that affects the <BodyPart>brain</BodyPart> and adrenal glands.

<Compound>Oleic acid</Compound> inhibited cancer cell growth and survival in low metastatic carcinoma cells, such as gastric carcinoma <CellLine>SGC7901</CellLine> and <BodyPart>breast</BodyPart> carcinoma <CellLine>MCF-7</CellLine> cell lines.

<Compound>Linoleic acid</Compound> belongs to the <Compound>omega-6 fatty acids</Compound>.

<Compound>Linoleic acid</Compound> was reported to be a strong anticarcinogen in a number of animal models.

<Compound>Linoleic acid</Compound> reduces risk of colon and <BodyPart>breast</BodyPart> cancer and lowers cardiovascular disease risk and inflammations.

<Compound>Linolenic acid</Compound> belongs to <Compound>omega-3 fatty acid</Compound>.

A previous study reported that <Compound>alpha-linolenic acid</Compound> (ALA) inhibited the human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell proliferation.

Another study reported that apoptosis of hepatoma cells was induced by the <Compound>alpha-linolenic acid</Compound> enriched diet which correlated with a decrease in <Compound>arachidonate</Compound> content in hepatoma cells and decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression.

<Compound>Gamma-Linolenic acid</Compound> (GLA) and <Compound>alpha-linolenic acid</Compound> (ALA) exhibited greater than 90% cytotoxicity between 500 M and <Compound>squalene</Compound>, mM against all but two malignant microorgan cultures tested in 5-10% serum.

GLA and ALA killed tumor at concentrations of 2 mM and above in tests using 30-40% serum.
