    <Pattern>the 10% acetone in ch2cl2 fractions from the chromatography of the crude leaves extract was rechromatographed lupeol, ) in 5% etoac in petroleum ether to afford lupenone, lupeol, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>the 40% to 50% acetone in ch2cl2 fractions from the chromatography of the crude leaves extract were combined and rechromatographed lupeol, ) in 15% etoac in petroleum ether to afford chlorophyll a, lupeol, mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by et2o.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>the dichloromethane extract of samanea saman afforded epilupeol , lupenone and chlorophyll a from the leaves; lupenone, and lupeol from the peduncle; and lupeol, unsaturated triglycerides , alpha-spinasterol , and alphaspinasterone from the twigs.</Pattern>
