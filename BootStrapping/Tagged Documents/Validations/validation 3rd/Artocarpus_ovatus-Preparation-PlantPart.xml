    <Pattern>179 www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com we report herein the isolation and identification of 3beta-friedelinol , squalene , polyprenol , triacylglycerols , and chlorophyll a (fig. ) from the dichloromethane extract of the leaves of artocarpus ovatus.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>isolation the air-dried leaves of artocarpus ovatus (336.9 g) were ground in a blender, soaked in ch2cl2 for polyprenols, days and then filtered.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>silica gel chromatography of the dichloromethane extract of the air-dried leaves of artocarpus ovatus led to the isolation of 3beta-friedelinol [8, 9], squalene [10, 11], polyprenol [11, 12], triglycerides , and chlorophyll a [7, 11]. the structures of beta-friedelinol, squalene, polyprenols, triacylglycerols, chlorophyll a, were identified by comparison of their 1h and/or 13c nmr data with literature data [8-12]. although bioassays were not conducted on the isolated compounds, there were previous studies that reported on their biological activities. beta-friedelinol showed only antibacterial activity (mic = 12.5-100 mg/ml) and no antifungal activity.</Pattern>
    <Pattern>the crude extract from the leaves were fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of acetone in dichloromethane (10% increment) as eluents.</Pattern>
