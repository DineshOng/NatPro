    <Pattern>. chemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract of the flowers of duranta erecta l. has led to the isolation of oleanolic acid , a mixture of alpha-amyrin and beta-amyrin in a 3:1 ratio, phytyl fatty acid esters , and triacylglycerols , the structures of 1-4b were identified by comparison of their nmr data with literature data.</Pattern>
