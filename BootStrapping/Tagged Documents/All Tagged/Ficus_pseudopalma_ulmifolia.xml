<Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> and <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> afforded <Compound>squalene</Compound>, <Compound>polyprenol</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound> and <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>.

<Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> also yielded <Compound>lupeol fatty acid ester</Compound>, <Compound>lupenone</Compound>, <Compound>oleanone</Compound>, and <Compound>ursenone</Compound>, while <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> also afforded <Compound>lutein</Compound>, <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound>, <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound>, <Compound>phytol</Compound>, <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, <ChemicalClass>sitosterol</ChemicalClass>, and <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>.

Their structures were identified by NMR spectroscopy..

The diversity of Philippine plants is exceptional, however, many have yet to be studied for their chemical constituents.

<Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> and <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> are endemic and endangered Philippine trees with no reported chemical studies.

Thus, this research was conducted to isolate and identify the <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> soluble secondary metabolites in both trees.

<Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> is a medicinal and ornamental tree found throughout the <Location>Philippines</Location>.

A <Preparation>decoction</Preparation> of the <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart> is used for the treatment of <BodyPart>kidney</BodyPart> stones and <Illness>diabetes</Illness>, while the young shoots are eaten as vegetables (Stuart <CellLine>2008</CellLine>).

On the other <BodyPart>hand</BodyPart>, <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> has no reported medicinal properties.

The hard and rough <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart> are used to clean cooking utensils and to scour wood.

The <PlantPart>fruits</PlantPart> are edible, but has little flavor (Jansen et al. ). We report here the isolation and identification of the <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> soluble constituents of <Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> and <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym>.

<Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> afforded the <ChemicalClass>triterpenes</ChemicalClass>: <Compound>ursenone</Compound> , <Compound>beta-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound> , <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound> , <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound> , <Compound>oleanone</Compound> , <Compound>lupeol fatty acid ester</Compound> , <Compound>lupenone</Compound> , and <Compound>squalene</Compound> ; and <Compound>polyprenol</Compound> , while <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> yielded the <ChemicalClass>triterpenes</ChemicalClass>: <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound> , <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound> , -amyrin fatty acid ester , <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound> , <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound> , and <Compound>squalene</Compound> ; <Compound>polyprenol</Compound> , <Compound>phytol</Compound> , <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound> , <Compound>lutein</Compound> , <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound> , and <ChemicalClass>sitosterol</ChemicalClass> (10) (Figure 1).

This is the first report on the isolation of the aforementioned compounds from <Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> and <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym>.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedures: NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer in CDCl at 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 125 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh), while the TLC was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254.

The plates were visualized with vanillin-H2SO4 and warming.

No. , December 2009 207 is alpha to a <Compound>carbonyl</Compound>, and a methyl triplet at 0.88 for <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, an acetoxy methyl was detected at 2.01 for <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>,

The 13C NMR spectrum for <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, gave resonances for the long <Compound>chain fatty acid methylene</Compound> carbons centered at 29 <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound>, <Compound>carbonyl</Compound> carbon of the <Compound>ester</Compound> at 173 <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound>, and the methyl carbon at the end of the <Compound>fatty acid</Compound> chain at 14.

These resonances for <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, were replaced in <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, by the resonances for the acetoxy carbons at 171.0 and 21.

3.

<Compound>Ursenone</Compound> <Compound>ursenone</Compound>, <Compound>oleanone</Compound> <Compound>oleanone</Compound>, and <Compound>lupenone</Compound> <Compound>lupenone</Compound>, have similar 1H NMR resonances to -amyrin acetate <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound> <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>, and <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound> <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound>, respectively, except in the regions where their structures differ, e.g., around C-3 where the acetates were replaced by carbonyls.

Thus, the resonances at 2.01 for the acetoxy methyl and <Compound>squalene</Compound>, 40 for the <Compound>oxymethine</Compound> protons of <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>, and <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound>, were not found in <Compound>ursenone</Compound>, <Compound>oleanone</Compound>, and <Compound>lupenone</Compound>,

The 13C NMR resonances for the acetoxy carbons at 171.0 and 21.3, and the <Compound>carbinyl</Compound> carbon resonances at 80 <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, for <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>, and <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound>, were replaced by the <Compound>carbonyl</Compound> carbon resonances at 217 <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, for <Compound>ursenone</Compound>, <Compound>oleanone</Compound>, and <Compound>lupenone</Compound>, (Hisham et al. ; Clen et al. ). Although bioassays were not conducted on the isolated compounds, there were previous studies that reported on their biological activities.

<Location>Alpha-Amyrin</Location> acetate has been reported to possess hypoglycemic activity (Narrender et al. ), while <Compound>lupeol</Compound> exhibited antiurolithiatic and diuretic activity (Vidya et al. ). <Location>Alpha-Amyrin</Location> acetate may be one of the active constituents in the anti-diabetes property of <Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym>.

<Compound>Lupeol</Compound> prevented the formation of vesical calculi and reduced the size of the preformed stones in rats (Anand et al. ). This indicates that <Compound>lupeol</Compound> may be one of the active constituents in the treatment of <BodyPart>kidney</BodyPart> stones by <Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym>.

<Location>Alpha-Amyrin</Location> and <Compound>beta-amyrin</Compound> were reported to posses <BioAct>anti-inflammatory</BioAct> activity (Recio et al. ; Madeiros et al. ), while <Compound>alpha-amyrin</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin</Compound>, and the 3-O-acyl derivatives of <Compound>alpha-amyrin</Compound> and -amyrin exhibited analgesic property (Otuki et al. ; Soldi et al. ). <Compound>Squalene</Compound> significantly suppresses colonic ACF formation and crypt multiplicity.

This strengthens the hypothesis that <Compound>squalene</Compound> possesses chemopreventive activity against colon carcinogenesis (Rao et al. ). <Compound>Squalene</Compound> has cardioprotective effect which is related to inhibition of lipid accumulation by its hypolipidemic properties and/or its <BioAct>antioxidant</BioAct> properties (Farvin et al. ). <Compound>Lutein</Compound> and zeaxanthin may have roles in protecting against age-related macular degeneration (Mozaffarieh et al. ). <Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in human solid tumors such as colon and <BodyPart>breast</BodyPart> cancers (Park et al. ). <Compound>Stigmasterol</Compound> lowers plasma cholesterol levels, inhibits intestinal cholesterol and plant <ChemicalClass>sterol</ChemicalClass> absorption, and suppresses hepatic cholesterol and classic <Compound>bile acid</Compound> synthesis in Winstar as well as WKY rats (Batta et al. ). A <Compound>polyprenol</Compound> from the ethanol <Preparation>extract</Preparation> of <Synonym>Coccinia ethyl</Synonym> acetate in petroleum ether.

The less polar fractions afforded a mixture of <Compound>ursenone</Compound>, <Compound>oleanone</Compound>, and <Compound>lupenone</Compound>, followed by a mixture of <Compound>beta-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, and <Compound>lupeol fatty acid ester</Compound>,

The more polar fractions were rechromatographed in 5% <Compound>ethyl acetate</Compound> in petroleum ether to yield a mixture of <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, and <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>, from the less polar fractions, while <Compound>polyprenol</Compound>, was obtained from the more polar fractions.

The <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> <Preparation>extract</Preparation> of the air-dried <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> (742 g) was chromatographed on a silica gel column using increasing proportions of <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> at 10% increment.

The 10% <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> fraction was rechromatographed in petroleum ether.

The less polar fractions afforded <Compound>squalene</Compound>, and <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound>, The more polar fractions were rechromatographed by gradient elution technique.

The column was first eluted with 2.5% <Compound>ethyl acetate</Compound> in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>, and <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound>, followed by 5% <Compound>ethyl acetate</Compound> in petroleum ether to afford a mixture of <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, and <Compound>beta-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>,

The 20% <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> fraction was rechromatographed in 10% <Compound>ethyl acetate</Compound> in petroleum ether to afford <Compound>polyprenol</Compound>, The 40% <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> fraction was rechromatographed in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> to afford <Compound>phytol</Compound>, The 50% <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> fraction was rechromatographed in <Compound>dichloromethane:diethyl</Compound> ether:acetonitrile (8:1:1) to afford a mixture of <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, and 10 after washing with petroleum ether.

The 60% <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> fraction was rechromatographed in <Compound>dichloromethane:diethyl</Compound> ether: acetonitrile (8:1:1) to afford <Compound>lutein</Compound>, after washing with petroleum ether, then <Compound>diethyl</Compound> ether..

The <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> extracts of the air-dried <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Ficus pseudopalma</Synonym> and <Synonym>Ficus ulmifolia</Synonym> afforded terpenoids and <ChemicalClass>sterols</ChemicalClass> by silica gel chromatography.

These compounds were identified by comparison of their 13C NMR spectral data with those of -amyrin fatty acid ester <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, (Menezes et al. ), <Compound>beta-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound> <Compound>beta-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, (Menezes et al. ; Wang 2007; Barreiros et al. ), <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound> <Compound>beta-amyrin acetate</Compound>, (Derome 1987), <Compound>lupeol fatty acid ester</Compound> <Compound>lupeol fatty acid ester</Compound>, (Wang 2007), <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound> <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound>, (Derome 1987), <Compound>squalene</Compound> <Compound>squalene</Compound>, (Brown & Martens 1977), <Compound>polyprenol</Compound> <Compound>polyprenol</Compound>, (Rideout et al. ), <Compound>phytol</Compound> <Compound>phytol</Compound>, (Ragasa et al. ), <Compound>lutein</Compound> <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound>, (Largo et al. ), <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound> <Compound>lutein</Compound>, <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound> <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, and <ChemicalClass>sitosterol</ChemicalClass> 10 (Cayme and Ragasa 2004) reported in the literature.

The structure of <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound> <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound>, was deduced by comparison of its 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data with those of <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound> <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>,
