Cycas, the only currently known <MedicinalPlant>genus</MedicinalPlant> of the Family <Family>Cycadaceae</Family>, are considered as fossil plants.

Their long existence and persistence through time have sparked special interest in their biology and evolution.

The cycads resemble palms in morphology, thus are commonly called <MedicinalPlant>sago palm</MedicinalPlant>.

These are widely distributed in the <Location>Tropics</Location>, with species found in <Location>Asia</Location>, <Location>Africa</Location>, Southeast <Location>Asia</Location>, <Location>Pacific</Location>, and <Location>Australia</Location>.

They also grow on volcanic, limestone, ultramafic, sandy, or even water-logged soils in grassland and forest habitats.

Of the eleven cycad species in the <Location>Philippines</Location>, ten are endemic to the country.

Except for our recent paper on the chemical constituents of <Synonym>Cycas sancti-lasallei</Synonym>, there are no reported studies on the chemical constituents of these endemic cycad species.

This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of Cycas species endemic to the <Location>Philippines</Location>.

In an earlier study, we reported the isolation of <Compound>squalene</Compound>, <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, and <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> from the <PlantPart>sarcotesta</PlantPart>; <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> and <Compound>phytyl fatty acid esters</Compound> from the <PlantPart>endotesta</PlantPart>; <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound>, <Compound>triglycerides</Compound>, and <Compound>beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters</Compound> from the <PlantPart>sclerotesta</PlantPart>; and <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> and <Compound>beta-sitosteryl fatty acid esters</Compound> from the <PlantPart>bark</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Cycas sancti-lasallei</Synonym>.

We report herein the isolation of <Compound>pinoresinol</Compound> , <Compound>lariciresinol</Compound> , <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> , and fatty alcohols from the <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> <Preparation>extract</Preparation> of <Synonym>Cycas vespertilio</Synonym> <PlantPart>male cone</PlantPart>.

Mixtures of <Compound>alpha-amyrin acetate</Compound> and <Compound>lupeol acetate</Compound> ; and <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound> and <Compound>stigmasterol</Compound> were also obtained from the <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> <Preparation>extract</Preparation>.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General experimental procedure NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for13 C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh).

Thin layer chromatography was performed with plastic backed plates coated with silica gel F254 and the plates were visualized by spraying with <Compound>vanillin</Compound>/H2SO4 solution followed by warming.

Plant material <Synonym>Cycas vespertilio</Synonym> A. Lindstr. & K. D. Hill <PlantPart>male cone</PlantPart> were collected from <Location>Iloilo</Location>, <Location>Panay Island</Location>, <Location>Philippines</Location> in April 2013.

Voucher specimens were collected and authenticated by one of the authors (EMGA) and deposited in the De La Salle University-Manila Herbarium (DLSUH 3112).

General isolation procedure A glass column 18 inches in height and <Compound>affordedpinoresinol</Compound>, 0 inch internal diameter was used for the chromatography of the crude extracts.

Twenty milliliter fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed in appropriate solvent systems until TLC pure isolates were obtained.

A glass column 12 inches in height and 0 <Compound>triglycerides</Compound>, inch internal diameter was used for the rechromatography of smaller fractions from the first column.

Five milliliter fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns.

One milliliter fractions were collected.
