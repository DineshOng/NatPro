<Compound>nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound>, ; 2015: 016-021 Although no biological activity tests were conducted on the isolated compounds, a literature search of <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, <Compound>nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound>, <Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>Chlorophyll</Compound>, revealed that these have diverse bioactivities.

<Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound> was reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against Bowes (melanoma) and <CellLine>MCF7</CellLine> (<BodyPart>breast</BodyPart>) cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 152 M and 113 M, respectively.

Furthermore, <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, exhibited cytotoxicity against human <BodyPart>stomach</BodyPart> adenocarcinoma (AGS) cell line with 60.28% growth inhibition.

In search of substances that inhibit the hemolytic activity of human serum against erythrocytes, <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, was evaluated on its anticomplement activity.

Compound <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, was found to exhibit potent anti-complement activity (IC50 = <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, 0 0. M) on the classical pathway of the complement, as compared to the positive control, <Compound>tiliroside</Compound> (IC50 = 76 <Compound>triacylglycerol</Compound>, <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, M).

A study reported that alkyl <Compound>4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound> compounds: <Compound>docosyl</Compound> and <Compound>tetracosyl 4-hydroxy-transcinnamate</Compound> caused NUGC cells to survive 67% on treatment with 50 M.

Furthermore, in the <Compound>superoxide</Compound> scavenging activity, alkyl <Compound>4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound> compounds: 1-tetradecyl <Compound>4-hydroxycinnamate</Compound> and <Compound>1-eicosanyl 4hydroxycinnamate</Compound> exhibited IC50 values of 416 M and 477 M, respectively.

In the DPPH radical scavenging activity, both compounds gave IC50 values of >100 M.

<Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> was observed to have growth inhibitory effects on human <BodyPart>breast</BodyPart> <CellLine>MCF-7</CellLine> and <CellLine>MDA-MB231</CellLine>adenocarcinoma cells.

<Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> was shown to be effective for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

<Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> was also reported to attenuate <Compound>betacatenin</Compound> and PCNA expression, as well as quench radical in-vitro, making <Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> a potential <BioAct>anticancer</BioAct> drug for colon carcinogenesis.

<Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> can inhibit the expression of <CellLine>NPC1L1</CellLine> in the enterocytes to reduce intestinal cholesterol uptake.

<Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound> was reported to induce apoptosis mediated by the activation of ERK and the downregulation of Akt in MCA-102 <Compound>murine</Compound> fibrosarcoma cells.

<Compound>Chlorophyll</Compound> and its various derivatives are used in traditional medicine and for therapeutic purposes.

Natural <Compound>chlorophyll</Compound> and its derivatives have been studied for <Illness>wound</Illness> healing , <BioAct>anti-inflammatory</BioAct> properties (Larato and Pfao, 1970), control of calcium <Compound>oxalate</Compound> crystals , utilization as effective agents in <Compound>photodynamic</Compound> cancer therapy (Sternberg et al., 1998; Nourse et al., 1988; Henderson et al., 1997), and chemopreventive effects in humans (Egner et al., 2001; Egner et al., 2003).

A review on digestion, absorption and cancer preventive activity of dietary <Compound>chlorophyll</Compound> has been provided (Ferruzzi and Blakeslee, 2007)..

<Synonym>Cordia dichotoma</Synonym> is a medicinal tree with many reported biological activities.

This study reports on the isolation of compounds (<Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, <Compound>nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound>, <Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>Chlorophyll</Compound>, <Compound>triacylglycerol</Compound>, ) from the <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> extracts of the <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart> and <PlantPart>stems</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Cordia dichotoma</Synonym>.

Compounds 14 have been reported to possess <BioAct>anticancer</BioAct> and <BioAct>cytotoxic</BioAct> properties.

The <BioAct>antioxidant</BioAct> property of <Compound>nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound>, cholesterol lowering effect of <Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound>, and <Illness>wound</Illness> healing effect of <Compound>Chlorophyll</Compound>, have also been reported.

Thus, the medicinal properties of <Synonym>Cordia dichotoma</Synonym> maybe partly attributed to <Compound>Alpha-Sitosteryl-3alpha-glucopyranoside-6'-O-palmitate</Compound>, <Compound>nervonyl 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamate ester</Compound>, <Compound>Beta-Sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>Chlorophyll</Compound>, which were reported to exhibit diverse biological activities..
