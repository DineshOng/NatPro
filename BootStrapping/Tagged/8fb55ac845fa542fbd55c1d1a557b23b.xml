This study was conducted as part of our research on the chemical constituents of trees found at the De La Salle UniversityManila campus.

In this study, the isolation and identification of <Compound>epilupeol</Compound> , <Compound>lupenone</Compound> and <Compound>chlorophyll a</Compound> from the <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart>; <Compound>lupenone</Compound>, and <Compound>lupeol</Compound> from the <PlantPart>peduncle</PlantPart>; and <Compound>Lupeol</Compound>, unsaturated <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> , <Compound>spinasterol</Compound> , and <Compound>spinasterone</Compound> from the <PlantPart>twigs</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Samanea saman</Synonym> are reported.

MATERIALS AND METHODS General Experimental Procedures NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS spectrometer in CDCl at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 150 MHz for 13C NMR spectra.

Column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh), while the TLC was performed with plastic-backed plates coated with silica gel F254.

The plates were visualized with vanillin-H2SO4 and warming.

A glass column (18 inches in height and <Compound>epilupeol</Compound>, 0 inch internal diameter) was packed with silica gel.

The crude <Preparation>extract</Preparation> was fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> (10 % increments) as eluents. mL fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed.

A glass column (12 inches in height and 0 <Compound>triglycerides</Compound>, inch internal diameter) was used for the rechromatography. mL fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. mL fractions were collected.

Sample Collection The sample was collected from the De La Salle University-Manila Campus in July 2013.

<Compound>triglycerides</Compound> was identified as <Synonym>Samanea saman</Synonym> Jacq Merr at the Bureau of Plant Industry, <Location>Manila</Location>, <Location>Philippines</Location>.
