67 was performed with silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh), while the TLC was performed with plastic-backed plates coated with silica gel F254.

The plates were visualized with vanillin-H2SO4 and warming.

A glass column (18 inches in height and <Compound>alphacopaene</Compound>, 0 inch internal diameter) was packed with silica gel.

The crude <Preparation>extract</Preparation> was fractionated by silica gel chromatography using increasing proportions of <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> (10 % increments) as eluents. mL fractions were collected.

All fractions were monitored by thin layer chromatography.

Fractions with spots of the same Rf values were combined and rechromatographed.

A glass column (12 inches in height and 0 <Compound>lutein</Compound>, inch internal diameter) was used for the rechromatography. mL fractions were collected.

Final purifications were conducted using Pasteur pipettes as columns. mL fractions were collected.

Sample Collection <PlantPart>Leaf</PlantPart> samples of <Synonym>Aphanamixis polystachya</Synonym> were collected from <Location>Bacnotan</Location>, <Location>La Union</Location>, <Location>Philippines</Location> in March 2013.

<Synonym>Aphanamixis polystachya</Synonym> was authenticated at the Jose Vera Santos Herbarium, Institute of Biology, University of the <Location>Philippines</Location>, Diliman, <Location>Quezon City</Location>, <Location>Philippines</Location> where a voucher specimen was deposited with accession number 14669.

The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to afford the crude <Preparation>extract</Preparation> (49 g) which was chromatographed using increasing proportions of <Compound>acetone</Compound> in CH2Cl2 at 10 % increments by volume as eluents.

The CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed using petroleum ether as eluent to afford <Compound>alphacopaene</Compound>, (35 mg).

The 10 % <Compound>acetone</Compound> in CH2Cl2 fraction from the chromatography of the crude <Preparation>extract</Preparation> was rechromatographed in petroleum ether to afford <Compound>squalene</Compound>, (15 mg) and <Compound>beta-carotene</Compound>, (12 mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 20 % <Compound>acetone</Compound> in CH2Cl2 fraction was rechromatographed in 10 % EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford <Compound>polyprenol</Compound>, (10 mg).

The 30 % <Compound>acetone</Compound> in <Compound>dichloromethane</Compound> fraction was rechromatographed in 15 % EtOAc in petroleum ether to afford <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>lutein</Compound>, mg) after washing with petroleum ether.

The 40 % to 60 % <Compound>acetone</Compound> in CH2Cl2 fractions were combined and rechromatographed in CH3CN:Et2O:CH2Cl2 (0.5:0.5:9 by volume) to afford <Compound>lutein</Compound>, (28 mg) after washing with petroleum ether, followed by <Compound>diethyl</Compound> ether.
