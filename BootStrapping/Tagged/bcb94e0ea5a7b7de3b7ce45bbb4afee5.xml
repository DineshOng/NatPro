. <Synonym>Artocarpus ovatus</Synonym> Blanco, an endemic Philippine tree, produces strong and durable timber which is used for construction [<Compound>beta-Friedelinol</Compound>, <Compound>Squalene</Compound>, ]. A latex obtained from the tree has potential for use as a chewing gum base , while the roasted <PlantPart>seeds</PlantPart> are eaten.

There is no reported study on the chemical constituents of <Synonym>Artocarpus ovatus</Synonym>.

However, congeners of the tree have been studied for their chemical constituents and biological activities.

There are about 50 species of the genus <Location>Artocarpus</Location> (<Family>Moraceae</Family>) which are sources of edible <PlantPart>fruit</PlantPart> and timber and are used in folk medicines.

A review of the chemical constituents, biological and pharmacological activities of <Location>Artocarpus</Location> has been provided.

Compounds from <Location>Artocarpus</Location> species exhibit diverse biological activities including <BioAct>antibacterial</BioAct>, antitubercular, <BioAct>antiviral</BioAct>, <BioAct>antifungal</BioAct>, antiplatelet, antiarthritic, tyrosinase inhibitory and cytotoxicity.

<Location>Artocarpus</Location> species are used for treatment against inflammation, malarial <Illness>fever</Illness>, diarrhoea, <Illness>diabetes</Illness> and tapeworm infection.

They are rich in phenolic compounds such as <ChemicalClass>flavonoids</ChemicalClass>, stilbenoids, arylbenzofurons and <Compound>jacalin</Compound>.

This study is part of our research on the chemical constituents of the genus <Location>Artocarpus</Location> found in the <Location>Philippines</Location>.

In another study, the <PlantPart>leaves</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Artocarpus altilis</Synonym> yielded <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>triglycerides</Compound>, <Compound>squalene</Compound>, <Compound>polyprenol</Compound>, <Compound>lutein</Compound> and <Compound>fatty acids</Compound>, while <Synonym>Artocarpus odoratissimus</Synonym> afforded <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, <Compound>triglycerides</Compound> and <Compound>fatty acids</Compound> from the flesh of the <PlantPart>fruit</PlantPart> and <PlantPart>seeds</PlantPart>; and <Compound>beta-sitosterol, fatty acids</Compound> and hydrocarbons from the <PlantPart>fruit rind</PlantPart>.

Furthermore, the unripe <PlantPart>fruit</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Artocarpus heterophyllus</Synonym> afforded <Compound>cycloartenone</Compound>, <Compound>cycloartenol</Compound>, and a diastereomeric mixture of <Compound>Squalene</Compound>, 3-butanediols.

Recently, we reported the isolation of <Compound>lupeol</Compound>, <Compound>alphaamyrin</Compound>, <Compound>beta-amyrin</Compound>, <Compound>lupeol fatty acid ester</Compound>, <Compound>alpha-amyrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, <Compound>beta-myrin fatty acid ester</Compound>, <Compound>betulin</Compound>, <Compound>3beta,28dihydroxyolean-12-ene</Compound>, <Compound>oleanolic acid</Compound>, <Compound>beta-sitosterol</Compound>, and <Compound>chlorophyll a</Compound>from the <PlantPart>twigs</PlantPart> of <Synonym>Artocarpus ovatus</Synonym>.
